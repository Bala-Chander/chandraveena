##बाबुल मोरा, नैहर छूटो ही जाए (Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Hi Jaye)##

This is an immortal song in Raga Bhairavi, further immortalised by the legendary Indian film actor / singer K.L.Saigal in the film Street Singer.

Many rulers of erstwhile princely states of Indian were great patrons of Art, Dance and Music. Some were very good artists themselves. One among these was Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the 19th century Nawab of Awadh. The above poetry was composed by the Nawab when he was exiled from his beloved Lucknow by the British Raj. Here he uses the metaphor of a bride's farewell from her father's home.

The meaning of the line is "O My Father, I am leaving home !"

Many Indian classical musicians feature this composition in Raga Bhairavi.

In this session, I present a brief Alap and a composition in Tivratal (7 beats). You can further explore Raga Bhairavi in [6 takes on Bhairavi](/blog/release1-6takes-on-bhairavi). 

This is a recording of a live performance held at a Siddhi Vinayaka Temple, Vadodara.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Bhairavi
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. Here a short Alap is presented.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Bhairavi (also called Sindhu Bhairavi)

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Todi

**Melakarta** - Hanumatodi (Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st and 2nd prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 12 PM), though its now become an all Prahar Raga!

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. This Raga has all komal (or flat) notes. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala

Tivratala has 7 beats split as 3 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Tivratala are given below.

**Tala** - Tivratala

**Beats** - 7 (3+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
