Ragas in Indian Classical music have often taken inspiration from folk tunes, and then formalised them according to the principles of the Indian Raga system. Read my posts on this very interesting topic of Lakshya (Presentation) and Lakshana (Grammar) of Music - [here](/blog/music-as-a-performing-art) and [here](/blog/grammar-of-music).

There is a tribe of people in Indian known as Bairagi, who are basically devotees of Vishnu. Bairagi, a alteration on the word Vairagi - means "one who has freed himself from worldly desires". Many of this sect of people perform pujas and other priesthood practices in temples. Considering many shlokas are chanted in Raga Bairagi, is it possible that this Raga's origin is from this sect ?

It is now a well formed Raga, presented in many classical concerts. Some classifications put Raga Bairagi under Bhairav family. I am of a different opinion. Lets briefly look at it. Bhairav notes are Sa re Ga ma Pa dha Ni. Bairag notes are Sa re ma Pa ni. As you can see, Bairagi excludes Ga, da, and has komal ni whereas Bhairav has Tivra Ni. Niether structurally nor scale wise Bairagi has any relation to Bhairav.

I classify it under Gaula - which is Sa re ma Pa Ni, in which Tivra Ga is occasionally used. Ga Varjit (dropped), and Vikrita Ni (modified Tivra Ni to Komal ni) will scale wise and structurally give Raga Bairagi.

(See Program Notes below for nomenclature details).

In this session, I present *Raga Bairagi* on Chandraveena. I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Alapana and Tanam.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Bairagi
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Bairagi  

**Scale** - Sa re ma Pa ni

**Family** - Gaula (Jod Raga formed by combining Raga Ahiri (Sa re Ga ma Pa Dha ni) and Raga Bhairav (Sa re Ga ma Pa dha Ni))

**Melakarta** - Varjit (Re, dha) Janya of Ratnangi (Sa re Re ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st and 2nd prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 12 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g.,Ga, Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Varjit Raga
A Varjit Raga is a Janya (derived) Raga of a Melakarta (parent scale) in which one or more notes are dropped from the parent scale. In this case, Tivra Re and Komal Dha are dropped from the parent scale Ratnanagi.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
