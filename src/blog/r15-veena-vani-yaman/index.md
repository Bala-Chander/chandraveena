In the tradition of Indian Classical music, **वीणा** (Veena), **वाणी** (Voice) and **वेणु** (Bamboo flute) represent a time honoured trio of mediums for performing music, recognized since the ancient times. They were considered the supreme form of musical mediums in *Gandharva Sangeet* (celestial music). It has been said that during Vedic rituals, especially, during *Samagana* rituals, the head priest was often accompanied by his wife on the Veena. Of course, since then a lot of time has passed and both the music and the instrument Veena have evolved.

Till recent times, many vocalists were often trained on Veena. A Veena is a sensitive instrument capable of creating the most subtle of intonations, called microtones. Vocalists were often trained to sing with the Veena, in order to be pitch perfect and to be able to master microtones. Musicans like Muthuswamy Dikshitar, M S Subbalakshmi, Bande Ali Khan, Ziauddin Dagar were master vocalists and veena players. Except for Bande Ali Khan, the other three went on to pursue and focus on vocal music. Bande Ali Khan played the Rudra Veena, though he had many vocal students, and is considered to be the founder of *Kirana Gharana* style of Khyal music. Even till the 18th and 19th century, it was common for vocalists to be often accompanied by Veena. Today we often see vocalists accompanied by violin or harmonium, or sometimes by Sarangi.

As an example, here is a [recording of Madurai Shanmugavadivu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNdsow608iA) (mother of M S Subbalakshmi), singing and playing the Saraswati Veena.

In this session, we present a Chandraveena - Vocal duet in Raga Yaman. Here we render a detailed Raga Alapana. The Raga Alapana, consisting of Alap and Jod, also known as Alapana and Tanam. 

We are pleased to feature Aparna Shastri on vocals. She is a trained vocalist under master vocalist late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. She has also received guidance from Pandit Uday Bhawalkar and Ustad Mohi Bahauddin Dagar.

# A Note on Raga Yaman

Time and again, we have talked about evolution of Indian classical music in different contexts. Here, I want to share my observations on Raga Yaman or Kalyani. Lets look at the basic scale of the Raga:

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni (Please read Program Notes below for nomenclature)

In Indian musical tradition, many Ragas evolved from Jati-Murchhana system, which to put it simply is change of mode/scale system. The scale of Yaman as described above can be got from an ancient Indian scale - *Shadaj Gram* - by simply moving the *Graha* (Home note) to *Gandhar* of Shadaj Gram. This scale is also similar to the Greek/Western mode - [Lydian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_mode) mode. However, there isnt much mention of this scale in the Indian musical tradition till the 15th/16th century. In some scriptures of the South, as late as 18th century, Kalyani scale has been classified as *Desya Raga* (meaning, a Raga from outside the region). Desya Ragas, though recognised, didnt have a pride of place in the musical system, and were not recommended for extended rendition. Another such desya raga is Todi.

So, it is possible that the definition of "outside the region" could have been North India or outside of India, this aspect is not very clear. However, over the last 100-150 years, Todi and Kalyani have become an integral part of South Indian music, so much so that one cant imagine a *Carnatic Kutcheri* without Kalyani or Todi. Extensive Alapana and Pallavi or Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi are rendered in Todi and Kalyani. Some musicians were even honored with the Raga name for their mastery! For eg, Todi Sitaramayya was renowned for this rendering of Todi, and so was the great Nadaswaram Vidwan T.N.Rajaratinam Pillai.

Assimilation from other cultures, and evolution of music has been a very important aspect of Indian classical music. I often read and hear debates on "pure Indian classical music" - whether its related to music of different regions, or different schools of music or different traditions. A point to ponder here is  - "what is pure Indian classical music?"!

A last point. There are some schools of thought which believe Yaman and Yaman Kalyan are two different Ragas, based on the use of Shuddha or Komal Madhyama in the scale. I differ on this. The basic scale of Yaman/Yaman Kalyan is as mentioned above. As a Lakshya(presentation), sometimes Shuddha/Komal Madhyama is used for *ati-shringar*. What does it mean? *Shringar* is embellishment or ornamentation. *Ati-shringar* is very subtle ornamentation. Usage of Shuddha madhyama in Yaman/Yaman Kalyan/Kalyani is optional, but when used, it is used as a *ati-shringar* note to add that extra emotional content. This does not make the Raga a different one.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Yaman
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. This has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. Here only Alap and Jod are presented. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. 

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Yaman

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - Kalyan

**Melakarta** - Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Na Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 4th and 5th prahar (equivalent to 3 PM - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
