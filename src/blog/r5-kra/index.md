Raga Asavari is an ancient scale, its what we call an Audav (Pentatonic) - Sampoorna (Heptatonic) Vakra Raga. The scale of the Raga is Sa Re ma Pa dha Sa" - Sa" ni dha pa ma ga Re Sa (read the notes on Raga details below for nomenclature). Along came a creation Raga Jaunpuri. To know more about this Raga, read my post on [Raga Jaunpuri - A Royal Raga](/blog/r2-jaunpuri). This Raga has the same scale as Raga Asavari. Over a period of time, it became so popular that Raga Asavari had an identity crisis ! Though same say they are both one and the same, I tend to disagree. Nevertheless, to overcome this identity issue, the second of the original of Raga Asavari, Tivra Rishab was flattened to Komal Rishab - and hence the name Komal Rishab Asavari.

However, there is a scale Asaveri, a thematic variation on Saveri. This Raga has the same scale as Komal Rishab Asavari.

Here, I present a detailed Alap in Komal Rishab Asavari consisting of three sections - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This alap performance is accompanied by a very unique drone (Tanpura) tuned to the scale of the Raga. In this unique performance, try and hear the difference.

## Program Notes

### Alap in Raga Komal Rishab Asavari
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. 

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Komal Rishab Asavari

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Asavari

**Melakarta** - Vikrit Raga of Natabhairavi (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st and 2nd prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 12 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re in Natabhairavi scale above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., dha and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Vikrit Raga
A vikrit raga is a derived scale from a Melakartha in which a note has been modified. In this case, Tivra Rishab of Melakartha Natabhairavi has been flattened to Komal Rishab.

### Vakra Raga
Even though scales in Indian Classical music are defined by a set of ascending - descending notes, sometimes, a Raga has a zig-zag melodic approach. Such Ragas are called Vakra Ragas.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
