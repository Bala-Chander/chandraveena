The philosophy of this site reflects the philosophy of my music, or at least I hope so. And the philosophy of my music reflects my life and my identity.

I have often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and their inter-relationship. In the early years of learning music, it was all about learning techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher as shaped by ones’ capability, and attempting to put it all together as a performer.

But what am I performing? Am I a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background, or none of the above? These have been uncomfortable questions, raised by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music.

This also led me to go back further in time, to study the evolution of music itself in India, and also all over the world. I went to study and to try and understand some of the Sutras and Shastras of Indian music, and to listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk!

As I started unravelling the music, I started understanding myself better - and I realised that as a musician, my life has been a journey through music and my music in an expression of the journey of my life. I am happy to borrow from the wise old people who coined the term *Maarga Sangeet* - Music as a Path of Life - to describe my pursuit of music.

Every individual's journey is unique and different, and so is mine. As you read some of my travels, for they are inner travels, what i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. And as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues ! Forever.
