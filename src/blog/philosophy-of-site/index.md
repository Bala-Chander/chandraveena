## Universality of Music

> "There is a certain Universality to Music, adorned by local and regional influences"

Did you know ? That Balaswamy Dikshitar, brother of the great composer Muthuswamy Dikshitar, introduced Violin to Carnatic Music ? He was so intrigued by the sound of Violin in the British Band in Chennai that he decided learn Violin and played in the British Band. Feeling its appropriateness for Carnatic Music, he started experimenting using Violin in Carnatic Music. Today, you cant think of a *Carnatic Kutcheri* without Violin.
Did you know ? John Maclaughlin, the jazz guitarist and founder of Mahavishnu Orchestra, learnt Veena under the great scholar Dr. S Ramanathan, and is highly influenced by the Indian music, and its percussion system.
Read my story on how today's popular Sarod evolved from the Afghan Rabab (link to the blog post)
Or take at a more generic level. What Western musicians call C Major scale, is called Bilawal in the North Indian music, and Shankarabharanam in the South.

There are countless such examples. Or take my own case. As a school kid in Madurai, I was drawn to the sound of Sarod having never even seen it. Later, during my Sarod learning days in Mumbai, I was drawn to the sound and music of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar's Rudra Veena. Its often said that early influences shape our thoughts and the life journey we take. So it has been with me. My early exposure to the beautiful sacred chants and traditional compositions at dawn in Madurai temples, listening to All India Radio broadcasting Madurai Mani Iyer, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, M S Subbulakshmi, Hirabai Barodekar, Mysore Doraiswamy Iyengar, Amjad Ali Khan.. and so many others. Why have I taken a mixture of names ? Because I was exposed to listening to music from all over India. And later in life, as i started learning music more seriously, my thoughts were further honed and shaped by my interactions with my Gurus.

So, what is my music ? To answer that, lets understand my approach and philosophy better !

### What is Philosophy ?

What is Philosophy ? Why is Philosophy necessary ? What does it mean to me in my context ? Setting the foundation for this understanding will hopefully enable you to make sense of this post better.

Philosophy (from the Greek word Philosophia) literally means "love of wisdom". Then again, what is wisdom ? Wisdom can be understood as experiential knowledge, based on self-understanding, thinking, insight and experience of living, all iterated multiple times. Philosophy therefore could be understood as a set of living principles which act as a reference guide to a consistent way of living. In a continuously moving world, it becomes necessary as an anchor, lest we wander, stray and aimlessly grope for meaning. The principles may be guided by the combination of local society and culture, global interactions and ones' own individualistic thoughts.

### What does Philosphy mean for me ?

I have often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and their inter-relationship. 

Who am I and what am I performing? Am I a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background, all of the above or none of the above? What is my individuality ? I have often been told by my Guru that my music should be a reflection of my personality and character, and that raises the question of what am I ? These have been uncomfortable questions, raised by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music.

In my quest to understand music itself better, I went back further in time, to study the evolution of music itself in India, and also all over the world. I took up to study and to try and understand some of the ancient scriptures of Indian music, and to listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk! I started seeing patterns. There are similarities, and yet differences.

I have heard traces of Sarang in Kora music, scales of Darbari in Middle Easter music, what is called Bhoop in North Indian music goes by the name Mohanam in the South Indian music, Dhrupad musicians pronounce the solfas Te Ta Ra Na in their Alap exploration of the Raga, and South Indian musicians pronounce the same as Ta Da Ri Na Na. North Indian musicans, especially instrumentalists and Dhrupad vocalists play whats called Alap, Jod, Jhala and Composition, and the same is called Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi in the South Indian terminology.

Local lifestyle, languages, cultural values, folk music, rites and rituals, evolution history are few of the important regional influences that could shape the variations and presentation of music - but underlying all that is a certain Universality to Music.

How does it all come together for me ?

### My Journey

In the early years of my musical training, it was all about learning the style and techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher as shaped by ones’ capability, and attempting to put it all together as a performer.

Over a period of time, as my understanding of music goes deeper, beyond the basics but weaving together the basics and techniques, I hope to present my music in  my own individualistic style - a sum total of my life, thoughts, experiences and musical values based on my understanding and interpretation of Indian Music. All my varied training in Indian music, exposure to several forms of music from around the world, guidance from my Gurus, understanding the evolution of Indian music through scriptures have all gone into forging a path for me. 

Eventually, I hope that my music is a reflection of my identity.

### Conclusion

Every individual's journey is unique and different, and so is mine. As you read some of my travels, for they are inner travels, what i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. And as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues ......
