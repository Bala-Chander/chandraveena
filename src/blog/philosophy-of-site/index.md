## In Pursuit of Simplicity

> "Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication" - Leonardo Da Vinci

We often equate sophistication to complex, brilliance, savvy etc. On the contrary Simplicity requires deep understanding. Simplicity is elegance, graceful. Simplicity is simply beautiful !

The philosophy of this site reflects the philosophy of my music, or at least I hope so. And the philosophy of my music reflects my life and my identity.

### What is Philosophy ?

Hmmm, thats all quite high flying. Lets for a short while get back to fundamentals. What is Philosophy ? Why is Philosophy necessary ? What does it mean to me in my context ? Setting the foundation for this understanding will hopefully enable you to make sense of this post better.

Philosophy (from the Greek word Philosophia) literall means "love of wisdom". Then again, what is wisdom ? Wisdom can be understood as experiential knowledge, based on self-understanding, thinking, insight and experience of living, all iterated multiple times. Philosophy therefore could be understood as a set of living principles which act as a reference guide to a consistent way of living. In a continuously moving world, it becomes necessary as an anchor, lest we wander, stray and aimlessly grope for meaning. The principles may be guided by the combination of local society and culture, global interactions and ones' own individualistic thoughts.

### What does Philosphy mean for me ?

I have often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and their inter-relationship. 

Who am I and what am I performing? Am I a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background, all of the above or none of the above? What is my individuality ? I have often been told by my Guru that my music should be a reflection of my personality and character, and that raises the question of what am I ? These have been uncomfortable questions, raised by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music.

In my quest to understand music itself better, I went back further in time, to study the evolution of music itself in India, and also all over the world. I took up to study and to try and understand some of the Sutras and Shastras of Indian music, and to listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk!

As I started unravelling the music, I started understanding myself better and therefore as a consequece understand music better - a cycle repeating itself. I realised that as a musician, my life has been a journey through music and my music an expression of the journey of my life. I am a sum total of my experiences. I am happy to borrow from the wise old people who coined the term *Maarga Sangeet* - Music as a Path of Life - to describe my pursuit of music.

### My Journey

So what does it all mean ? 

In the early years of my musical training, it was all about learning the style and techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher as shaped by ones’ capability, and attempting to put it all together as a performer.

As my understanding of music goes deeper, beyond the basics but weaving together the basics and techniques, I hope to present my music in a simple but elegant and sophisticated way, in  my own individualistic style - a sum total of my thoughts, experiences and values, but within the broad framework of Indian Music.

> The journey is about understanding one note at a time, one beat at a time, and continue weaving a garland of notes

### About the site

A concerted effort has been made to keep consistent the philosophy of music, self and the site. Weaving together the latest technology, and content, keeping with this philosophy of simplicity, the site has minimalistic design with clear navigations to main content, and further context based navigation. The logo design and the colour combinations are representative of the contours and colours of Chandraveena. An attempt has also been made to break down explanations of musical concepts and terminologies, and keep it simple to understand. 

> Simple and elegant.

### Conclusion

Every individual's journey is unique and different, and so is mine. As you read some of my travels, for they are inner travels, what i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. And as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues !
