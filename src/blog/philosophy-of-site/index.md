## Universality of Music

In music, purity of the musical form is often mistakenly seen as sealing off outside influences. But musical ideas manage to diffuse.

For example, did you know that Balaswamy Dikshitar, brother of the great composer Muthuswamy Dikshitar, introduced the Violin to Carnatic Music? He was so intrigued by the sound of Violin in the British Band in Chennai that he decided to learn Violin and played in the British Band. Feeling its appropriateness for Carnatic Music, he started experimenting with using Violin in Carnatic Music. Today, you cannot think of a *Carnatic Kutcheri* without a Violin.

Did you know that John McLaughlin, the jazz guitarist and founder of Mahavishnu Orchestra, learned Veena under the great scholar Dr. S Ramanathan, and is highly influenced by Indian music, and its percussion system? Or how today's popular Sarod [evolved](/blog/sarod-and-sursringar/) from the Afghan Rabab?

Or consider at a more generic level - what Western musicians call the C Major scale, is called Bilawal in North Indian music, and Shankarabharanam in South India.

> "There is a certain Universality to Music, adorned by local and regional influences."

My own case is no different. As a school kid in Madurai, I was drawn to the sound of Sarod having never even seen it. Later, during my Sarod learning days in Mumbai, I was drawn to the sound and music of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar's Rudra Veena. It's often said that early influences shape our thoughts and the life journey we take. So it has been with me. My early exposure to the beautiful sacred chants and traditional compositions at dawn in Madurai temples, and listening to All India Radio which featured Madurai Mani Iyer, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, M S Subbulakshmi, Hirabai Barodekar, Mysore Doraiswamy Iyengar, Amjad Ali Khan and so many others, has undoubtedly influenced my music. Being exposed to listening to music from all over India, my thoughts were further honed and shaped by my interactions with my Gurus, as I started learning music more seriously.

## Universality or Confusion?

But having so many influences was also a source of confusion. I often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and their inter-relationship.

Who am I and what am I performing? Am I a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background, or all of the above, or none of the above? Where is my individuality? I have often been told by my Guru that my music should be a reflection of my personality and character, and that leads to the question of who am I? These have been uncomfortable questions, raised by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music.

In my quest to understand music itself better, I went back further in time, to study the evolution of music in India, and also all over the world. I took the time to study and to try and understand some of the ancient scriptures of Indian music, and to listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk! I started seeing patterns. There are similarities, and yet differences.

I have heard traces of Sarang in Kora music, scales of Darbari in Middle Eastern music. What is called Bhoop in North Indian music goes by the name Mohanam in the South Indian music. Dhrupad musicians pronounce the solfas Te Ta Ra Na in their Alap exploration of the Raga, and South Indian musicians use Ta Da Ri Na Na. North Indian musicians, especially instrumentalists and Dhrupad vocalists play whats called Alap, Jod, Jhala and Composition, and the same is called Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi in the South Indian terminology.

Local lifestyle, languages, cultural values, folk music, rites and rituals, and history are but a few of the important regional influences that could shape the variations and presentation of music - but underlying all that is a certain Universality to Music.

## My Journey

So how did it all come together for me?

In the early years of my musical training, it was all about learning the style and techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher as shaped by ones’ capability, and attempting to put it all together as a performer.

Over a period of time, as my understanding of music goes deeper, beyond the basics but weaving together the basics and techniques, I hope to present my music in my own individualistic style - a sum total of my life, thoughts, experiences and musical values based on my understanding and interpretation of Indian Music. All my varied training in Indian music, exposure to several forms of music from around the world, guidance from my Gurus, understanding the evolution of Indian music through scriptures have all gone into forging a path for me.

<mark>Some comments on how specifically this path is forged. Being true to the musical form (raga and tala) and yet being open minded to ideas and influences in improvisation. Or something on these lines. </mark>

I once read something interesting. It goes :

>*Instead of thinking outside the Box, Get rid of the box*

This assumes ofcourse that one knows what the box is ! Often *Thinking out of the box* is misconstrued as unregulated thinking or process. Thats anarchy ! Thats a misnomer. Thinking out of the box - is , first you understand the box, you understand everything in the box, you understand the boundary values of the box, internalise the box and push to the limits. Having mastered everything inside, one could prod and poke outside the boundary, and explore. Eventually, at the highest level of creative thinking, one could drop the box altogether because even in sleep one would know where the box is ! 
I am still in the box, wiser and more knowledgeable than before but still exploring, understanding the limits of the box, and prodding at the boundaries. Chandraveena, the instrument, is a culmination of understanding the contemplative music I wished to make, understanding the beauty of Saraswati Veena and maintaining its sonic character and structure , and yet get the deep resonance of Rudra Veena. Digging into my past and child hood memories, my music is an attempt in bringing together the beauty of temple chants, principles of Dhrupad, subtle Gamakams (tremolos) of the South Indian style, alap jod jhala of the North with the Ragam Tanam Pallavi of the South, the glides of Sarod which drew me as a kid, the complex rhythmic structure and possibilites that exist in the South Indian percussion system..thats a lot.. and its a sincere effort to bring them all together in a seamless way. I hope, over a period of time, as I understand and experience music in more depth, I will eventually be able to drop the box.

> Maarga Sangeet - Seeking identity through the Path of Music

## Conclusion or Continuation?

Maarga Sangeet is about seeking and expressing one's identity through the medium of music. Every individual's journey is unique and different, and so is mine. My box has been the boundary values set by the prinicples of Dhrupad. Even as I am exploring the limits of Dhrupad, my own interpretation and expression of music has been influenced by my early exposures, the initial training in Saraswati Veena and Sarod and the belief in the underlying oneness of Indian music. Chandraveena itself has been inspired by the beauty of Saraswati Veena and Rudra Veena. What i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. I am aware there's a long walk ahead, and as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues ......
