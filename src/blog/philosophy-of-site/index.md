## In Pursuit of Simplicity

> "Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication" - Leonardo Da Vinci

We often equate sophistication to complex, brilliance, savvy etc. but it doesnt. On the contrary Simplicity requires deep understanding. Simplicity is elegance, graceful. Simplicity is simply beautiful !

The philosophy of this site reflects the philosophy of my music, or at least I hope so. And the philosophy of my music reflects my life and my identity.

I have often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and their inter-relationship. In the early years of learning music, it was all about learning techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher as shaped by ones’ capability, and attempting to put it all together as a performer.

But what am I performing? Am I a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background, all of the above or none of the above? These have been uncomfortable questions, raised by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music.

This also led me to go back further in time, to study the evolution of music itself in India, and also all over the world. I went to study and to try and understand some of the Sutras and Shastras of Indian music, and to listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk!

As I started unravelling the music, I started understanding myself better - and I realised that as a musician, my life has been a journey through music and my music in an expression of the journey of my life. I am a sum total of my experiences. I am happy to borrow from the wise old people who coined the term *Maarga Sangeet* - Music as a Path of Life - to describe my pursuit of music.

> The journey is about understanding one note at a time, one beat at a time, and continue traversing.

So what does it all mean ? Lets understand this concept from a real world situation. Lets take sports, to be specific, tennis. One of my favorites is Roger Federer - not just for his trophies, but also the way plays and approaches the sport. When I was a teenager learning tennis, lets look at the steps. I had a school tennis coach, who taught me the basics. The first step was to learn to hold the racquet with a proper grip, then you learn to swing the racquet, and hope it makes contact with the ball - more often than not swinging the air than hitting the ball ! The next step is to get the ball to the other side of the net, and they would go all over except to the other side of the net ! Once I could get the ball to the other side regularly, the next step was to make sure the ball landed within the court lines. And then I learnt to serve. When I could do these basic maneouvres, I learnt the rules of the game, and I could then play a tennis match.
Now Roger Federer is at an entirely different level. He just makes tennis "look" simple, graceful, elegant and sophisticated. Is it simple ? By no means. It has been achieved with years of training, and deep understanding of the sport, where he has been able to take the basics, develop his own style, and present a sophisticated way of playing "look" simple.

So it is with many subjects, so it is with music. As my understanding of music goes deeper, beyond the basics but weaving together the basics and techniques, I hope to present my music in a simple but elegant and sophisticated way, in  my own individualistic style - a sum total of my experiences and values.

So it is with the site. Weaving together the latest technology, and content, keeping with this philosophy of simplicity, the site has minimalistic design with clear navigations to main content, and further context based navigation. The logo design and the colour combinations are representative of the contours and colours of Chandraveena. Simple and elegant.

Every individual's journey is unique and different, and so is mine. As you read some of my travels, for they are inner travels, what i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. And as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues ! Forever.
