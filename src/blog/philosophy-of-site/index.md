The philosophy of this site reflects the philosophy of my music. I have often struggled with understanding my own self, my music, and the inter relationship. In the early years of learning music, its all about learning techniques, understanding the basic concepts of music, imitating the teacher limited to ones’ capability - and putting them all together as a performer.

But what am I performing ? Am i a Hindustani musician with a Carnatic background, or a Dhrupad musician with a Hindustani background, or an Indian musician with a complex background or none of the above ? There have been uncomfortable questions raised, all by myself to myself, in an attempt to better understand myself and my music. This also led me to go back further in time, in the evolution of music itself in India and all over the world, and to understand and study some of the Sutras, Shastras and listen to music from all over the world - from the African Kora to the jazz of Thelonious Monk !

As i started unravelling the music ,  i started understanding myself better - and I realised.... that’s my journey of my life through the eyes of music .. and hence the name of the site Maarga Sangeet - Music as a Path of Life.

Each ones’ journey is unique and different, and so is mine. As you read some of my travels, for they are inner travels, what i am today and what my music is today is a cumulative representation of all my experiences and thoughts. A music which is a culmination of years of training and understanding, and trying to express it in my own words. And as I understand this journey better, my music further evolves for as i walk the journey, i see new landscapes. I see a horizon, but no end... and hence... the journey continues ! Forever.
