There was a tradition among the Royal rulers of erstwhile princely states of India to train their heirs in 64 arts called Chatusashti Kalas. Along with art of warfare, art of archery  etc, they were also trained in performing arts such as Music, Dance, Drama etc. Many of these prince / princess went on to become connoisseurs and patrons of Art and Music, some of them continued to pursue art even as a Royal ruler. Famous examples include King of Travancore - Swathi Tirunal, Ruler of Thanjavur - Ragunatha Naik, Mughal ruler - Wajid Ali Shah, Ruler of Golconda - Adil Shah etc. One among these was Sultan Hussain Sharqi - Sultan of Jaunpur. A great connoisseur of music, and a musician himself, some believe Raga Jaunpuri was created by him. He has also often been credited with the evolution of Khyal style of Indian Classical Music.

Here I present a short Alap in *Raga Jaunpuri* followed by a Pallavi in Chautala. This Raga is also called Jeevanpuri in some parts of India.

## Program Notes

### Short Alap in Raga Jaunpuri
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. But here Balachander plays a short Alap to introduce the Raga before performing the Pallavi.

### Pallavi (composition) in Raga Jaunpuri set to Chautala
Pallavi is a melodic phrase or lyrics set to a fixed set of beats in a rhythmic cycle. The improvisation here is creating interesting rhythm based melodic patterns while maintaining the framework of the Raga. This part of the performance is accompanied by Pakhawaj.

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Jaunpuri (also called Jounpuri / Jeevanpuri)

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Asaveri

**Melakarta** - Natabhairavi (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 2nd and 3rd prahar (equivalent to 9 AM - 3 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2).

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
