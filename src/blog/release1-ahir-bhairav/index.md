description: "Raga Ahir Bhairav is a variety of Raga Bhairav. It is a mishra or a complex Raga, meaning, it is derived by the combination of two Ragas - Raga Ahiri and Raga Bhairav."

Indian classical music Ragas have often taken inspiration from folk tunes, and then formalised them according to the principles of Indian Raga system. Ahir is an ancient ethnic group in india who primarily were cattle farmers. Some claim to be descendents of the Yadava tribe from Krishna. Whatever maybe the case, as cattle grazers, did they have a typical folk tune , like a signature tune ? Is that where the origins of Raga Ahir lie ? 

In this session, I present Raga Ahir Bhairav on Chandraveena. Raga Ahir Bhairav is a mixture of two Ragas, Ahir and Bhairav. Ahir and Ahir Bhairav have the same notes, but distinguished by structural melodic differences. By the time scale distribution of Indian Raga System, both Ahir and Bhairav are morning ragas, and so is Ahir Bhairav. Here, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala. 

In the South Indian melakarta system, the 16th melakarta chakravakam has the same scale as Ahir Bhairav. The notes of this Raga are:

Sa re Ga ma Pa Dha ni  

Reading the scale: In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., re, ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalised first letter.
