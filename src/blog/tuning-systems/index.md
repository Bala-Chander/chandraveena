description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I talk about the tuning systems of India. Read on to find out more!"

## Introduction

Indian Classical Music was not always like we know and understand today. In an [earlier post](/blog/grammar-of-music/), we talked about the concept of *Adhara Shadaj* and how it changed Indian Classical music significantly.

In the pre-Adhara Shadaj era, Indian Classical music was based on concepts of *Gram*, *Murchhana* and *Jati*. In the post-Adhara Shadaj era (which is the present era), the core melodic concept in Indian Classical music is that of a *Raga*. We briefly talked about the important intervals (*Pancham*, *Madhyam* and *Gandhar bhav*), the pre-Adhara Shadaj era tuning system of 22 *Srutis* per octave and a reference tuning system of the present era, due to *Ramamatya* and *Venkatamakhin* which specifies how to divide an octave into 12 notes.

In this post, let us look at these tuning systems in some more detail. 

## Background

```
Editor's Note:

Here we cover the following:
1. India's capability in mathematics (arithmetic, algebra)
2. India's capability in wood-working, metallurgy, leather crafting
3. Instruments prevalent at different times in India
4. Literature prevalent at different times in India
5. Based on the above, the rest of the article is an educated interpretation
```

## Samvad or Consonance
Before we begin discussing tuning systems, let us recall the three *Samvads* or consonant intervals of *Pancham*, *Madhyam* and *Antara Gandhar*. These were recognised early on in the history of Indian Classical music, and they are quite natural and pleasing to hear today too.

## Tuning system of Natyashastra and Sangeet Ratnakar
With this background, let us turn to the pre-Adhara Shadaj era tuning system which divided an octave into 22 interval referred to as *Srutis*.

```
Editor's Note:

Here we talk about:
1. Bharat and Natyashastra
2. Sarang Dev and Sangeet Ratnakar
3. Other relevant texts of the time
4. Three Grams being cited
5. The peculiarity of Gandhar Gram
```

We will restrict ourselves to *Shadaj Gram*. There are two possible interpretations and both are worth checking. Bharat and Sarang Dev's *Chal veena* and *Achal veena* experiment works with both.

### Using Gandhar Bhav

```
Editor's Note:

Here we talk about the derivation using:
* Pancham interval is 13 Srutis
* Madhyam interval is 9 Srutis
* Gandhar interval is 7 Srutis (this is an assumption for ease of interpretation)
```

### Without using Gandhar Bhav

```
Editor's Note:

Here we talk about derivation using:
* From Sa, derive 11 steps by taking fifths
* Discard the 12th step which is very close to Sa
* From Sa, derive 10 more steps by taking fourths
* Discard the 11th step which is very close to Pa
* Total 22 intervals
```
