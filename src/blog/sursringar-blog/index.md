India is a country of fascinating myths and stories dating back to thousands of years - as it would be with any ancient culture. There are various anecdotes on the miracles of music, whether involving Tansen, or Swami Haridas or Muthuswamy Dikshithar. With a strong history of oral tradition from the Vedic times, and an aversion to written documentation, much of the information is carried down the generations by word of mouth. Some stories have survived, but many are lost and others have been reinterpreted with added spices!

One such story regarding the evolution of Sursringar goes as follows.

It is widely believed that Sursringar was invented by a *seniya rababiya*[^1] Jaffar Khan (1775 – 1825). His main motivation was to improve the resonance and the tonal quality of the *seniya rabab*.
The story goes that once Jaffar Khan and his cousin Nirmal Shah had to demonstrate their skill on seniya rabab and veena (been) respectively at the court of Benaras. Now, bear in mind that the rabab’s sound box was covered in hide, and its strings were mostly made from cat guts. Cat guts are not great for resonance and the instrument as a whole exhibited extreme sensitivity to weather in general and humidity or dampness in particular. You can imagine Jaffar Khan's predicament given their performance was slated to have happened during the monsoon season. After the excellent first performance by Nirmal Shah on the Veena, Jaffar Khan felt disadvantaged in front of the veena due to the limitations of his rabab. He sought a month’s time from the Maharaja of Benaras, promising to play at the end of it. It is said that during this period, Jaffar Khan, stayed with an instrument maker, and evolved a new instrument based on rabab which we now know as the *Sursringar*.

[^1]: A *seniya rababiya* is a player of the *Seniya Rabab*. Now the story of the *Rabab* and in particular the *seniya rabab* is itself worth writing a post about. Stay tuned!

Now that’s history. Or the legend. Whatever may be the story behind its evolution, I can assure you that the Sursringar is one of the most charming and beautiful instruments, full of resonance, depth and beauty. It definitely well suited for playing the Dhrupad style of music, although it can be a challenging instrument to play. I hope to share a music clip of my sarod and sursringar in a subsequent post. The sursringar has alternately been called the *Swarsringar*, and its cousin the *Sarod* as the *Sharadiya Veena*[^2].

[^2]: Just how the Sarod and Sursringar are related is also a subject worth writing a post about. Hopefully, I will cover it in a subsequent post.

I hope you enjoyed the story. If there is any related topic you would like to see covered, please [drop me a line](/contact/#leave-a-message).
