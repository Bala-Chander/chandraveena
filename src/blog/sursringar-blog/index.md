India is a country of fascinating myths and stories dating back to thousands of years - as it would be with any ancient culture. There are various anecdotes on the miracles of music, whether involving Tansen, or Swami Haridas or Muthuswamy Dikshithar. With a strong history of oral tradition from the Vedic times, and an aversion to written documentation, much of the information is carried down the generations by word of mouth. Some stories have survived, but many are lost and others have been reinterpreted with added spices!

One such story regarding the evolution of Sursringar goes as follows. Wait ! Before I embark on the story of Sursringar, a little introduction to related items in the story - Rabab and Veena.

### Rabab

Without getting too much into the etymology and history of the word Rabab, I would like to present here from a perspective on the evolution of instruments. 

Rabab is a very popular instrument of the Afghan region for many centuries. Influenced  by Persian music, Rabab was often played by Pashtun / Pathan musicans of the Afghan region. The migration of Rabab happened through horse traders and military conquests. Central Asian horses were highly prized, both in military and for personal purposes. It is also highly likely that Rabab came to India during the conquest of Babar, along with the military troops  and horse traders.

What is a Rabab ?

Rabab is a short necked lute, carved out of a single block of wood, resonator covered with skin, with a wooden fretboard, and gut strings and 3-4 gut frets. The acoustics of gut strings, woodern fretboard and the flesh of the finger tips didnt give much sustain / resonance to the instrument. As a folk instrument , or to sing ballads of valor in war, this was probably sufficient. As needs of the music evolved, Rabab too evolved, initially adding sympathetic strings (hand made copper wires) which gave extra sustain and loudness to the instrument. 

It is believed Tansen further evolved this instrument to suit the style of music prevelant. This instrument was larger in size, with bigger resonator, deeper sound and better sustain / resonance. 

The early rabab got to be called Afghan or Kabuli Rabab and the latter Seni or Punjab Rabab.

### Veena

String instruments are generecally called Veena. Many different types of Veenas have, and exist in India. Some of the types of veena are Tritantri (3 strings), Chitra Veena (Slide Veena), Shatatantri Veena (100 strings), Kinnari Veena, Kachhapi Veena (resonator in the shape of tortoise shell) etc. One among these, and one of the grandest of Veenas is Rudra Veena. Leaving aside the metaphysical aspects of the instrument, Rudra Veena is considered one of the most complete instrument for indian music based on its ability to follow voice, and produce subtle intonations. 

Rudra Veena is a stick zither, a long hollow bamboo stem (some are made of wood), with two big goud (pumpkin) resonators.

### Story of Sursringar

It is widely believed that Sursringar was invented by a *seniya rababiya*[^1] Jaffar Khan (1775 – 1825). His main motivation was to improve the resonance and the tonal quality of the *seniya rabab*.
The story goes that once Jaffar Khan and his cousin Nirmal Shah had to demonstrate their skill on seniya rabab and veena (been) respectively at the court of Benaras. Now, bear in mind that the rabab’s sound box was covered in hide, and its strings were mostly made from catguts. Guts are not great for resonance and the instrument as a whole exhibited extreme sensitivity to weather in general and humidity or dampness in particular. You can imagine Jaffar Khan's predicament given their performance was slated to have happened during the monsoon season. After the excellent first performance by Nirmal Shah on the Veena, Jaffar Khan felt disadvantaged in front of the veena due to the limitations of his rabab. He sought a month’s time from the Maharaja of Benaras, promising to play at the end of it. It is said that during this period, Jaffar Khan, stayed with an instrument maker, and evolved a new instrument based on rabab which we now know as the *Sursringar*. Some of the fundamental changes were fixing of metal plate to the whole surface of finger board, use of metal / wire strings in place of gut strings, and replacement of wooden resonator with gourd (possibly inspired by the gourd resonators of Veena).

Interesting fact :

Though Nirmal Shah and Jaffer Khan are portrayed as competitors (possibly), they were both descendents of Tansen ! Nirmmal Shah was a descendent of Tansen from the daughter's lineage, and Jaffer khan was a descendent from the son's lineage.

Now that’s history. Or the legend. Whatever may be the story behind its evolution, I can assure you that the Sursringar is one of the most charming and beautiful instruments, full of resonance, depth and beauty. It definitely well suited for playing the Dhrupad style of music, although it can be a challenging instrument to play. I hope to share a music clip of my sarod and sursringar in a subsequent post. The sursringar has alternately been called the *Swarsringar*, and its cousin the *Sarod* as the *Sharadiya Veena*[^2].

[^2]: Just how the Sarod and Sursringar are related is also a subject worth writing a post about. Hopefully, I will cover it in a subsequent post.

I hope you enjoyed the story. If there is any related topic you would like to see covered, please [drop me a line](/contact/#leave-a-message).
