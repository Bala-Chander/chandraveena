India is a country of fascinating myths and stories dating back to thousands of years - as it would be with any ancient culture. There are various anecdotes on the miracles of music, whether its been Tansen, or Swami Haridas or Muthuswamy Dikshithar. With a strong history of oral tradition from the Vedic times, and an aversion to documenting or writing down, most information is carried down the generations by word of mouth. Some have stayed, many are lost, some are reinterpreted with added spices etc.

One such version on the evolution of Sursringar is as follows :

It is widely believed that Sursringar was invented by a seniya rababiya Jaffar Khan (1775 – 1825). His main intention was to improve the resonance and the tonal quality of the seniya rabab.
The story behind the invention of Sursringar is – once Jaffar Khan and his cousin Nirmal Shah had to demonstrate their skill on seniya rabab and veena (been) respetively at the court of Benaras. One has to keep in mind that rabab’s sound box is covered in hide, and the strings were mostly catguts – which in itself is not great for resonance - and added to it is extreme sensitivity to humidity, dampness etc – weather in general. This performance also happened to be during the monsoon season.
The first performance was by Nirmal Shah on the Veena. Feeling disadvantaged in front of the Veena due to limitations of rabab –  Jaffar Khan took a month’s time from the Maharaja of Benaras, promising to play at the end of it. Its said that during this period, Jaffar Khan, stayed with a instrument maker, and evolved a new instrument based on rabab – which is sursringar.

Now that’s history. Whatever may be the history , or evolution, I can assure you that it is one of the most charming and beautiful instrument full of resonance, depth and beauty. It definitely is one of the best instruments for the Dhrupad style of music – though its a challenging instrument to play.

Sursringar has alternately been called Swarsringar , and Sarod as Sharadiya Veena.

I hope to share an audio / video of my sarod / sursringar in one of the subsequent posts.
