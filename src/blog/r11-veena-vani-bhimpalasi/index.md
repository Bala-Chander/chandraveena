वीणा(Veena), वाणी(Voice) and वेणु(Bamboo flute) - the triumvirate of Indian music, three recoginsed mediums of expressing music since ancient times in Indian music. They were considered the supreme form of musical mediums in Gandharava Music (Celestial Music). It has been said that during Vedic rituals, especially, during Samagana rituals, the head priest was often accompanied by his wife on the Veena. Since then, however, both the music and the instrument Veena have evolved.

Till recent times, many Vocalists were often trained on Veena. Veena is a sensitive instrument capable of creating the most subtle of intonations, called microtones. Vocalists were often trained to sing with Veena, in order to be pitch perfect and master microtones. Musicans like Muthuswamy Dikshitar, M S Subbalakshmi, Bande Ali Khan, Ziauddin Dagar were master vocalists and veena players. Even till the 18th/19th century, it was common for vocalists to be often accompanied by Veena. Today we often see vocalists accompanied by Violin, or Harmonium and sometimes by Sarangi.

In this session, we present a Chandraveena - Vocal duet in Raga Bhimpalasi. This is rendered in two parts. The first part is the Raga Alapana, consisting of Alap, Jod and Jhala, also known as Alapana and Tanam. The second part is the composition set to a rhythmic cycle of 12 beats, known as Chautala.

Vocals have been rendered by Aparna Shastri. She is a trained vocalist under the master vocalist late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. She has also received guidance from Pandit Uday Bhawalkar and Ustad Mohi Bahauddin Dagar.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Bhimpalasi
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. This has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam. 

### Pallavi (composition) in Raga Bhimpalasi set to Chautala
Pallavi is a melodic phrase or lyrics set to a fixed set of beats in a rhythmic cycle. The improvisation here is creating interesting rhythm based melodic patterns while maintaining the framework of the Raga. This part of the performance is accompanied by Pakhawaj.

Here, we have taken a traditional Dhrupad composition for exploration. The lyrics of the composition are:

Sthayi/Pallavi: कुंजन में रचो रास अदभुत गति लिए गुपाल कुंडल की झलक देखि कोटि मदन टट को!
Antara/Anupallavi: अधर तो सुरंग रंग बांसुरी उपाय संग ऐसी छ बि देखि देखि इन्द्र धनुष पटको!

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Bhimpalasi

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni

**Family** - Palasi

**Melakarta** - Kharaharapriya (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni)

**Prahar** - 4th prahar (equivalent to 3 PM - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |

Sometimes, concerts are ended with what is called Tani Avartanam, where after the main rendition, the rhythm accompanist plays a solo. Here, after the completion of the Pallavi, Dhaval Mistry on Pakhawaj continues, and plays a solo exploring the rhythmic variations of Chautala.
