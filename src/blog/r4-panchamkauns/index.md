Raga *Malkauns*, also known as Raga *Hindolam* in parts of India, is a very popular Raga, usually sung in the late evening or night. Raga *Panchamkauns* as the name suggests, uses the note *Pancham* (Pa) in Malkauns. Sometimes, subtly using a note changes the entire character and feeling of a Raga, so much so that it feels like a completely different Raga. Panchamkauns also brings in changes to the melodic phrases of Malkauns, incorporating the Pancham without the note sounding dissonant.

Here I present the Raga as a derivative of *Natabhairavi*, belonging to the *Kaushiki* family of Ragas. This is a recording of a live performance held at Siddhivinayaka Temple, Dandia Bazaar, Vadodara.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Panchamkauns
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

### Pallavi (composition) in Panchamkauns set to Chautala
Pallavi is a melodic phrase or lyrics set to a fixed set of beats in a rhythmic cycle. The improvisation here is creating interesting rhythm based melodic patterns while maintaining the framework of the Raga. This part of the performance is accompanied by Pakhawaj.

### About the Raga

**Raga** - Panchamkauns

**Scale** - Sa ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Varja Raga of Kaushiki (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Melakarta** - Varja Raga of Natabhairavi (Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalised first letter.

**Varja Raga** - A Janya (derivative) Raga of a Melakartha in which  a note is dropped from the parent  Melakartha notes. In this Raga, Rishab has been dropped.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala

Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala
