There are varied accounts on the evolution of rabab, sarod and sursringar. Many have written articles, journal papers and books on the subject. Never minding the history and its evolution, I am interested in talking about the two instruments, its commonalities and differences.

As you can see from the picture, there are physical similarities between sarod and sursringar. Sursringar , in terms of time evolution, is older than the present day Sarod. The need for improved resonance and sustain compared to wooden fret board and gut strings in rabab led to the invention of sursringar - which has metal fretboard and metal strings. Larger in size than sarod, and replacing the hide with a large soundboard, sursringar has outstanding acoustics.

Traditionally, sursringar continued to be played in Dhrupad style, and with enough sustain, there wasn’t a need for “Taraf” or sympathetic strings that are seen in Sarod. It is also believed that Taraf strings interfere with finer tones, and hence sursringar is best played without Taraf. Sursringar also has a flat “Jawaari” bridge compared to the point shaped bridge of Sarod. The Jawaari capability of sursringar gives rise to rich harmonics and sound. Typically both instruments are played with either a wire plectrum, or a jawa (guitar style plectrum made of coconut shell)

There are two basic solfas or syllables of plectrum use in rabab/sarod/sursringar. The downward stroke is Da, and the upward stroke is Ra. And a combination of strokes can give rise to more syllables like Dire, Dra.. and a combination of syllables to form phrases like Da Ra Dire Dire etc. These phrases are often used in very complex rhythmic patterns, especially in the composition section.

Sursringar by temperament is suited for slow melodic exploration of Ragas (Alap). Although modern Sarod is capable of Alap, by temperament, it is well suited for fast playing, complex rhythmic patterns known as “tarparan”. Sarod, also has Taraf or sympathetic strings, to compensate for less resonance compared to Sursringar.
