There are varied accounts on the evolution of the rabab, the sarod and the sursringar. Many researchers and commentators have written articles, journal papers and books on the subject. Setting aside the history of these instruments, I would like to talk about sarod and sursringar, specifically their commonalities and differences.

As you can see from these pictures, there are physical similarities between sarod and sursringar. Sursringar, in terms of the evolutionary timeline, is older than the present day Sarod. It is very likely that the need for improved resonance and sustain as compared to what was possible with a wooden fret board and gut strings in rabab, led to the [invention of sursringar](/blog/sursringar-blog/). Hence, the Sursringar has a metal fretboard and metal strings. Being larger in size than a sarod and replacing its hide with a large soundboard, a sursringar has outstanding acoustics.

Traditionally, sursringar continued to be played in Dhrupad style, and with enough sustain, there wasn’t a need for *Taraf* or sympathetic strings that are seen in a sarod. By contrast, a sarod is equipped with taraf to compensate for lower resonance compared to a sursringar. It is also believed that the Taraf strings interfere with finer tones, and hence a sursringar is best played without Taraf. Sursringar also has a flat *Jawaari* bridge compared to the point shaped bridge of Sarod. This unique Jawaari capability of a sursringar gives rise to its rich harmonics and sound. Typically both instruments are played with either a *mizrab* - a wire plectrum, or a *jawa* - a guitar style plectrum made of coconut shell.

The plectrum on the right is wrapped with a cloth dipped in beeswax. With the player's body heat, this releases just enough wax for lubrication.

A mizrab has traditionally been used for playing a Veena, Sitar or Surbahar. There's mention of a wire plectrum used for playing sarod and sursringar too. But I’m not sure of the shape or model of it, and whether its the same as pictured above.

There are two basic solfas or syllables of plectrum use in a rabab, sarod or sursringar. The downward stroke is *Da*, and the upward stroke is *Ra*. Now, a combination of strokes can give rise to more syllables like *Dire*, *Dra*, etc, and a combination of syllables to form phrases like *Da Ra Dire Dire* and so on. These phrases are often used in very complex rhythmic patterns, especially in the composition section.

Sursringar by temperament is suited for a slow melodic exploration of Ragas (Alap). Although modern Sarod is capable of Alap, by temperament, it is well suited for fast playing, complex rhythmic patterns known as *Tarparan*.
