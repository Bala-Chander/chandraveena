Musical instruments change and evolve to keep pace with the changes in music. Some musical instruments go extinct, some are modifed and some new instruments emerge. 

Sitar today is a very sophisticated Indian classical music concert instrument. The word Sitar originates from Persian word [Sehtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setar). Both structurally, and acoustically, you can see and hear the difference in the two instruments. The evolution in the instrument happened out of the needs of Indian classical music.

[Surbahar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surbahar) is a bass instrument. It was likely invented around 1800's. The story that I have heard is that many Rudra Veena players of the past would not teach Rudra Veena to disciples outside of their family. So, for those who wished to play Dhrupad or Rudra Veena style of music, they were taught Surbahar. It is likely that this instrument was invented out of this need. For a long period of time, Alap was played on Surbahar, and faster compositions/gats were played on Sitar. Today, Sitar is a very versatile instrument, capable of playing Alap and Gats.

Chandraveena is a new musical instrument born out of my musical necessity. If you want to know the motivation for ["Why Chandraveena"](/blog/why-chandraveena) or the story of ["The Making of Chandraveena"](/blog/making-of-chandraveena), please read the linked posts. You can also know more about the comparitive study of Saraswati Veena and Chandraveena in this [post](/blog/the-musical-story-of-chandraveena).

Here I talk about different structural aspects of Sitar, Surbahar and Chandraveena. I compare and contrast the instruments along with short demos on all the instruments. 

I hope this information helps you in understanding these instruments better, and appreciate the music more.

### Raga Alapana in Raga Gavati on Sitar

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Ga and Dha in Gavati above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni in Rageshri. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
