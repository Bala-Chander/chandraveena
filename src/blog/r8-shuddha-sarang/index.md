Raga Shuddha Sarang belongs to the Sarang family of Ragas, and is an afternoon Raga. Its one of the many Ragas which uses both the Madhyams - komal madhyam and tivra madhyam. The melakarta classification of Ragas, which are 72 in number, are identically split into two sets of 36 each, distinguished by Madhyam. For eg, Raga Shankarabharanam, called Dheerashankarabaranam Melkarta is a komal madhyam Raga, and Melakarta number 29. The exact tivra madhyam equivalent in scale (all other notes being the same) is Kalyani, called Mechakalyani Melakarta, and its Melakarta number is 29+36 = 65. So, Melakartas are divided into 36 komal madhyam ragas, and equivalent 36 tivra madhyam ragas. Now, here is the dilemma - what do you do with ragas which both the madhyams ? Like for eg, here Shuddha Sarang. Some other Ragas are Lalit, Kedar, Kamod etc. While logical classification of 72 Melakarta system has its value, it sometimes poses problem in such situations. I have come across some earlier scriptures where Sarang was defined as a Mela in itself, but the system of classification was different from the current Melakarta system.

Within the limitations, I have chosen to take Shuddha Sarang as a Janya (derivative) raga of Melakarta Mechakalyani, for it features phrases derived from Kalyani. Its also a Bhashanga (note outside the scale) Raga.

In this presentation of *Raga Shuddha Sarang* on Chandraveena, I have *Alpatva* (very subtle and not often used) Tivra Dhaivat. I present here Raga Alapana in three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala also known as Alapana and Tanam.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Shuddha Sarang
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Shuddha Sarang

**Scale** - Sa Re ma Ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - Sarang

**Melakarta** - *Varjita* *Bhashanga* *Janya* of Mechakalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 3rd and 4th (equivalent to 12 PM - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Bhashanga Raga
A *Janya* (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, ma (komal madhyam) is outside of Kalyani (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni).

### Varjita Raga
A *Varjita* Raga of a Melakarta drops one or more notes from the parent scale. In this case, Ga is dropped from the original scale.

### Janya Raga
A *Janya* Raga is a derivative Raga from a parent Melakarta scale. Janya Raga could be Audav (pentatonic), Shadav (hexatonic) or Sampoorna (heptatonic).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
