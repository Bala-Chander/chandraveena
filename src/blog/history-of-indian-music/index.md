## Introduction
>Maarga Sangeet is a tradition of Indian music, a way of life where music becomes the artist's medium of communication.

From early Vedic periods, music has been recognised as a powerful means of expressing and stimulating emotions. As humans, we intrinsically respond to music and rhythm, regardless of the form and genre of music. Scientific research has shown that even plants and animals respond to music [^1]. The first significant step in the development of Indian music happened with the Saama Veda. Taking the ritualistic, introspective and philosophical chants from the Rig Veda, Saama Veda added an element of singing to Vedic recitation. Listen to this chant from Rig Veda.

[^1]: Scientists have studied the effects of music on non-human subjects including animals such as cats or monkeys, and even plants. The studies have found that music does have an impact on the health and well-being of the non-human subjects. For example, see [1](https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=ajps.2007.369.373), [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291086163_Effect_of_Music_on_Plants_-_An_Overview) and [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3677178/pdf/ars206.pdf) for music's effect on plants and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/laban.162), [5](https://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(15)00060-X/abstract) and [6](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/30.short) for music's effect on animals.

Rig Veda chants already incorporated the concept of intonations. The intonations are called Svarita (neutral drone), Udaatta (higher note) and Anudaatta (lower note). As you can hear from the example above, it is not a monotone chant, but there are accents to syllables which create a three note chant, called Gaathik chant. These early chant intonations are used in Indian music even today. Now, listen to this chant from Saama Veda.

As you can see, in Saama Veda singing, the number of notes has expanded beyond Rig Veda chants. If you are familiar with Indian music, you may notice early examples of musical characteristics like Meend (glides), Gamakam (note oscillation), Hrasva (short note) and Deergha (long note) which continue to be an integral part of Indian Music today.

Notice how even this small step of adding musical notes and phrases, already makes a big difference in the feeling evoked by Saama Veda singing, as compared to Rig Veda chants. Over time, the musical rules and principles evolved to take their own form and identity separate from Saama Veda, and came to be classified as an Upaveda (a subsidiary Vedic text) called the Gandharva Veda. It was the Gandharva Veda which first laid down the framework of Indian music. And from Gandharva Veda came the methods, structure and grammar to learn, practise and perform music - the first seeds of structured Indian Music.

## Raga and Tala system
>Statements about Raga and Tala System. And how it split up into Hindustani, Carnatic and Dhrupad.

Despite its ancient origins, Indian music has continuously evolved over millennia and remains very much contemporary and relevant today, for any artist who aspires to learn and walk the path of Maarga Sangeet. Today, it is practised and performed in a number of styles, popularly classified as Hindustani, Carnatic and Dhrupad, with a number of sub-styles within each style.
