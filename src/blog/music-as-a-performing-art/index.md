description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my understanding of Indian Classical music as a performing art!"

Indian Classical Music was not always like we know and understand today. Rather the [story of Indian music](/blog/history-of-indian-music/) has been one of continuous evolution over a period of 1500 - 2000 years. Despite many changes and a long evolution, many of the fundamental principles of Indian Ragas and Raga-based music have been around for many centuries. A more appropriate term for Indian Classical Music would be *Shastriya Sangeet* or music based on *Shastras* (scriptures).

Any public discourse or a presentation has two aspects to it. A deep understanding and knowledge of the subject, and effective communication. So it is with performing arts. Early in Indian tradition, all performing arts (music, dance, drama, etc) were categorised into two major parts - *Lakshana* (theory and grammar) and *Lakshya* (presentation). Here in this post, I will talk about music in particular.

A scripture related to *Lakshana* is referred to as a *Lakshanagrantha* (book of grammar). A few examples of Lakshangranthas related to music are *Sangeet Ratnakar*, *Dattilam*, *Svaramelakalanidhi*, *Chaturdandi Prakasika*, etc. These books have been written by eminent scholars, musicians and musicologists like *Sarangdev*, *Dattil*, *Raamamatya*, *Venkatmakhin*, among others. Some of these works also talk about lakshaya.

These scriptures have been written over a period of many centuries. As music evolved, many great musicians and musicologists analysed music of their times, and have documented the same in the form of lakshanagranthas. These scriptures not only standardised performance of Indian classical music, but also formed the basis for further development.

Lakshana and Lakshaya go hand in hand. In some instances lakshana was formed after lakshya to give a framework, for eg. creating a framework for a folk tune in Raga form. In other instances, lakshya follows lakshana, for eg. understanding the Janaka (derived) - Janya (parent) Raga relationship. To have a full command over Indian Classical Music, it is imperative to have a proper understanding of both lakshya and lakshana. 

A few examples of lakshana would be *Gamakas* (Intonations of notes), *Samvaditva* (Consonance pair of notes) etc. Few examples of Lakshaya would be *Bhava* (Mood of the Raga), *Laya* (maintaining proper rhythm), *Raga* (maintaining the structure of the Raga) etc. Lakshya also talks about etiquettes to be followed by an artist in a public performance.

While lakshanas create the framework, structure and consistency in presentation, that alone doesn't maketh the music. Within the framework, its the artists' skill and imagination to create aesthetic beauty and present a form that pleases him and others.
