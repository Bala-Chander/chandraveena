description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my understanding of what a Pallavi (composition) is. Pallavi is also popularly known as Bandish/Kriti. Read on to find out more!"

A typical presentation of an Indian Classical music performance has two parts : 

Anibaddha Sangeet - Raga Music which is not bound by lyrics, meter or tala. Eg, Raga Alapana. 

Nibadhha Sangeet - Raga Music which is bound by lyrics, meter and tala. Eg, Pallavi / Bandish / Kriti.

Here in this post, I will talk about Pallavi.


## Pallavi

The word Pallavi is believed to be a compound word made from 3 words: **Pa**dam, **La**yam, and **Vi**nyasam.

Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase, Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana. Pallavi is also popularly known as Kriti / Bandish.

Pallavi is often preceded by an Raga Alapana. You can read about the structure and performance of a Raga Alapana [here](/blog/raga-alapana). Any performance of Indian Classical Music is defined by Lakshanas (Grammar of Music) and Lakshyas (Presentation of Music). You can read an introduction to Lakshanas and Lakshyas [here](/blog/music-as-a-performing-art). A more detailed post on Lakshanas is [here](/blog/grammar-of-music).

This section of a musical presentation has also been referred to as Rupak Alapti. Rupak Alapti could also be considered as the precursor to modern day *Khyal* genre of Indian Classical Music. This has two characteristics - *Dhatu* (musical aspects) and *Matu* (Poetry or Lyrical aspects). Essentially, this is poetry set to music in a tala or rhythmic cycle of beats. 

Lets now look at Pallavi.

Here I make a distinction between Poetry and Musical Poetry. While generic poetry has its own structure and meaning, not all poetry works are suitable as a musical composition. In addition to poetic meaning, a musical poetry also needs to have a metre, a rhythm based structure, a musical structure where the musical and grammatical characterists of the Raga are maintained. A musical poetry composer is also known as *Vaggeyakar*. The meaning of the word is :

*Vak* - speech - here refers to words(sahityam). 

*Geya* - singing - here refers to setting the music. 

*Kaara* - the doer of the above acts (or anything in a context).

The different aspects of a Pallavi are :

### Padam

In today's common parlance, this section is also known as *Bandish* or *Kriti*. This can include the following stages:

* *Pallavi* or *Sthayi* - introductory lines showcasing the Raga structure.
* *Anupallavi* or *Antaraa* - bridge lines which connect two sections, or two halves of the octave.
* *Charanam* or *Sanchari* - a footnote or concluding part which again covers the whole Raga.
* *Anucharanam* or *Abhog* - an optional additional section of Sanchari which contains the composer's signature.

The *Pallavi* section within a Pallavi composition is the introductory phrase to the composition. 

*Anupallavi* is a sub-section of pallavi and follows pallavi. It connects Pallavi to the next section called Charnam. Anupallavi is also known as *Antaraa*.

*Charanam* footnote section or the concluding section of a composition. This section is also known as *Sanchari* (musically, moving all over the range of Raga). 

Sometimes there is a subsection called *Abhog* or *Anucharanam* which is also a form of sanchari, but it contains the composer's signature.

### Layam

These lyrics or musical phrases are set to different talas or rhythmic cycles like Aditala (8 beats), Chautala (12 beats), Mishra Chapu (7 beats), Jhaptala (10 beats), etc. The musical phrases are typically set in a way such that they line up with specific accents in the rhythmic cycle. For example, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase should match corresponding accents in the rhythmic cycle.

Indian rhythmic system is well evolved, and has many features. In addition to a repeating cycle, emphasis points, starting and ending beat, an important aspect of Indian Tala System is Jaati (literally meaning tribe, but musically meaning to a class of beats). You can read a more detailed understanding of Tala [here](/blog/Taladhyaya).

We recognise 5 types of rhythm divisions:

*Tisra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 3

*Chatursra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 4

*Khanda Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 5

*Misra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 7

*Sankeerna Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 9


Many different rhythmic combinations only limited by the artists' skill and imagination, can be created by a mix of these 5 Jaatis. 

### Vinyasam

*Vinyasam / Vistar* or rhythmic exploration of a musical phrase, also called Niraval uses different combinations of jaatis to create aesthetically beautiful variations. It needs to be borne in mind that in the process, the meaning and the beauty of lyrics / poetry should not be spoilt. 

It is also important to take note of *Hrasva* (short syllables) and *Deergha* (long syllables), for elongating a short syllable could either completely change the meaning of the word, or render it meaningless. 

*Sahitya Bhav* or the Spirit of the Composition is a very important consideration - at all times keeping the structure, meaning and beauty of the composition while musically and rhythmically exploring it is very important. The other important point to note is that the position of lyrical syllables in the rhythmic cycle needs to be maintained.

While the focus is on rhythmic improvisations, it is equally important to note that *Raga Bhava* (the mood of the Raga) is maintained within the confines of musical grammar as defined by Raga Lakshanas.

This four part composition was earlier known as Udgraha, Melapaka, Dhruva and Abhog in the Prabandha style of compositions. Prabandhas are not very prevelant now.
