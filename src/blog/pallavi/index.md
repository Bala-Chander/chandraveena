description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my understanding of what a Pallavi (composition) is. Pallavi is also popularly known as Bandish/Kriti. Read on to find out more!"

*Pallavi* is the **primary** format for developing and showcasing a Raga with rhythm and lyrics.

## Background
Recall from the earlier post on [Raga Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) that a typical performance of Indian Classical music has two parts:

* *Anibaddha Sangeet* - Raga music which is not bound by lyrics, meter or tala.

* *Nibaddha Sangeet* - Raga music which is bound by lyrics, meter and tala. Although parts of Nibaddha Sangeet are composed, it is still very much open to improvisation within the constraints of the lyrics, meter and tala.

Pallavi is the primary format of Nibaddha Sangeet. It is also popularly known as a composition, *Kriti* or *Bandish*.

## Overview

The word Pallavi is believed to be a compound word made from 3 words: **Pa**dam, **La**yam, and **Vi**nyasam:
* Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase,
* Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and
* Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana.

Pallavi is often preceded by an Raga Alapana. It can be a short Raga Alapana, or an extensive development referred to as *Ragam Tanam* or *Alap, Jod, Jhala*. You can read about the structure and performance of a Raga Alapana [here](/blog/raga-alapana/).

This section of a musical presentation has also been referred to as Rupak Alapti. Rupak Alapti could also be considered as the precursor to modern day *Khyal* genre of Indian Classical Music. 

## Structure of a Pallavi

Pallavi has two characteristics - *Dhatu* (musical aspects) and *Matu* (poetic or lyrical aspects). Essentially, it is poetry set to music, in a tala or rhythmic cycle of beats. 

Here I make a distinction between *literary* poetry and *musical* poetry. While literary poetry has its own structure and meaning, not all literary works are suitable as a musical composition. In addition to poetic meaning, a musical poetry also needs to have a metre, a rhythm based structure, and a musical structure where the musical and grammatical characteristics of the Raga are maintained.

A musical poetry composer is also known as *Vaggeyakar*. The meaning of the word is derived from its parts:
* *Vak* - meaning "speech" which refers to the lyrics (*Sahityam*) 
* *Geya* - meaning "singing" which refers to the tune, and 
* *Kar* - meaning the "doer" or "actor".

Let us look at each of the different aspects of Pallavi, *Padam*, *Layam* and *Vinyasam*. 

Here we will demonstrate different parts of Pallavi though audio/video clippings from a full performance. These clippings are from a Veena-Vani duet in Raga Bhimpalasi.

### Padam

This can include the following stages:

* *Pallavi* or *Sthayi* - main lines showcasing the Raga structure which are often repeated.
* *Anupallavi* or *Antaraa* - bridge lines which connect two sections, or two halves of the octave.
* *Charanam* or *Sanchari* - a footnote or concluding part which again covers the whole Raga.
* *Anucharanam* or *Abhog* - an optional additional section of Sanchari which contains the composer's signature.

This four part composition was earlier known as *Udgraha*, *Melapaka*, *Dhruva* and *Abhog* in the *Prabandha* style of compositions. *Prabandhas* are not very prevalent now.

Let us now hear the composition. The lyrics of the *Pallavi* or *Sthayi* are:

**कुंजन में रचो रास अदभुत गति लिए गुपाल कुंडल की झलक देखि कोटि मदन टट को|**

The lyrics of the *Anupallavi* or *Antara* are:

**अधर तो सुरंग रंग बांसुरी उपाय संग ऐसी छबि देखि देखि "मोहन के मुकुट पर मेरो मन अटके"|**

*The original version of the part in inverted commas as composed by Baiju is "इन्द्र धनुष पटको".

### Layam

These lyrics or musical phrases are set to different talas or rhythmic cycles like Aditala (8 beats), Chautala (12 beats), Mishra Chapu (7 beats), Jhaptala (10 beats), etc. The musical phrases are typically set in a way such that they line up with specific accents in the rhythmic cycle. For example, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase should match corresponding accents in the rhythmic cycle.

Indian rhythmic system is sophisticated and has many features. In addition to cycles and start, end and accent points, another important aspect of Indian Tala System is *Jati*. Although it is the same term as the *Jatis* which were precursors to *Ragas*, in the context of rhythm, a *Jati* refers to a rhythmic division or a grouping of notes.

There are five recognized types of *Jatis* or rhythmic divisions, namely, *Tisra*, *Chatursra*, *Khanda*, *Misra* and *Sankeerna* which respectively mean musical phrases created in groups of 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 notes. An artist can create many different rhythmic musical phrases by using these Jatis.

> Continuing with our demo, the composition in Raga Bhimpalasi is in Chautala (12 beats). This composition starts on beat 1. You can also observe the Vocalist - Aparna Shastri - indicating / gesturing with her hands the rhythmic cycle. With this information, watch the video above again, and try to follow the rhythmic cycle as per the artists' indication. As may have noticed, this part is accompanied by the percussion instrument *Pakhawaj*, played by Dhaval Mistry.

I have written a more detailed post on principles of Indian rhythmic cycles - [Tala](/blog/taladhaya). You can later read the post for a deeper understanding of rhythmic cycles, and revisit this post. 

### Vinyasam

*Vinyasam* (also called *Vistar* or *Niraval*) is a rhythmic exploration of a musical phrase. It uses different combinations of jatis to create aesthetically appealing variations. It needs to be borne in mind that in the process, the meaning and the beauty of lyrics or poetry should not be spoilt. 

It is also important to take note of *Hrasva* (short) syllables and *Deergha* (long) syllables in the song, for elongating a short syllable could either completely change the meaning of the word, or render it meaningless. 

*Sahitya Bhav* or the spirit of the literature is a very important consideration. An artist should maintain the structure, meaning and beauty of the composition, while musically and rhythmically exploring it. The other important point to note is that the positions of lyrical syllables in the rhythmic cycle need to be consistently maintained.

While the focus is on rhythmic improvisations, it is equally important to note that the *Raga Bhava* (the mood of the Raga) is maintained within the confines of musical grammar as defined by Raga Lakshanas.

Lets us continue with the same demo. Having established the lyrics, the tune based on the Raga and the rhythmic cycle, it is now time for improvisations. The words of the pallavi are used as the foundation for melodic and rhythmic improvisations within the framework established by the Raga and the Tala, while maintaining the sanctity of the lyrics.

## Note on Instrumental Pallavi

Often, Pallavis composed for vocal music, can also be rendered on a musical instrument. Note that on an instrument, there is no strict concept of Matu or lyrics but only Dhatu or notes. However, through a clever technique of strumming, bowing, blowing and modulating, the feeling of Dhatu can be created. This can be quite challenging. If listeners knows the Pallavi, they may enjoy the feeling of Dhatu and follow along. Otherwise, they would hear it just as an instrumental composition. Some Pallavis are difficult to render on instruments, due to the limit on the continuity of sound, although on a bowed instrument, they are still considered possible. 

There are Pallavis specifically composed for instruments, some of which are designed to take advantage of specific instrumental techniques of playing. These compositions are called *Gat*. These compositions are not based on Matu but only on Dhatu. They give complete freedom to the artist to explore rhythmic variations along with Raga improvisation, without the boundaries of Matu.

Even in vocal music, there are special Pallavis which are minimalist in nature with usually just one line of poetry, with plenty of gaps between the words. These Pallavis are exclusively designed to let the artist explore rhythmic and raga improvisations to the fullest extent. Here again, not as much significance is attached to Matu as it is to Dhatu. Such pallavis are also suitable for instrumental music.

> As you can see in the above demo, while Chandraveena can follow the tune of the Pallavi, it is difficult to express the words. This poses some limitation in the improvisation part since there are no words to go by.

## Summary

To summarise, a Raga is a musical structure which should be presented according to its prescribed Lakshanas. Raga Alapana is a prescribed method for presenting a Raga systematically. Pallavi is a further exploration of the Raga together with rhythmic cycles, lyrics and rhythmic accents.

Like in the case of Raga Alapana, the musical and rhythmic exploration and improvisation during a Pallavi, is also called *Manodharma Sangeet*. So it is a showcase of the artist's imagination, while staying within the framework of the Raga and Tala.

This post is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it provides a glimpse into the process of Pallavi. I also hope that this would enable you to follow and enjoy Chandraveena music and Indian Classical music in general.

## Notes to Readers

Please check my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPyMV4LS9YBePXM0mV4hjg"><inline-button background="#ff0000">YouTube</inline-button></a> and <a href="https://chandraveena.bandcamp.com/"><inline-button background="#408294">Bandcamp</inline-button></a> channels for recordings of Pallavi on Chandraveena.

Based on this article, you can try and identify the starting point, the emphasis point and the end point of the pallavi. Usually, I play single line Pallavis on Chandraveena. For lyrical and multi-section pallavis, listen to compositions of Tansen, Baiju, Thyagaraja, Muthuswamy Diskshithar, etc.
