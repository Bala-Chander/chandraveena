description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana and Pallavi is. Read on to find out more!"

## Pallavi

The word Pallavi is believed to be a compound word made from 3 words: **Pa**dam, **La**yam, and **Vi**nyasam.

Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase, Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana. This section of a musical presentation has also been referred to as Rupak Alapti or Nibaddha Sangeet (music which is bound - by lyrics, meter and Tala which are composed). Rupak Alapti could also be considered as the precursor to modern day *Khyal* genre of Indian Classical Music. This has two characteristics - *Dhatu* (musical aspects) and *Matu* (Poetry or Lyrical aspects). Essentially, this is poetry set to music in a tala or rhythmic cycle of beats.

These lyrics or musical phrases are set to different talas like Chautala (12 beats), Mishra Chapu (7 beats), Jhaptala (10 beats), etc. The musical phrases are typically set in a way such that they line up with specific accents in the rhythmic cycle. For example, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase should match corresponding accents in the rhythmic cycle.

Indian rhythmic system is well evolved, and has many features. In addition to a repeating cycle, emphasis points, starting and ending beat, an important aspect of Indian Tala System is Jaati (literally meaning tribe, but musically meaning to a class of beats). We recognise 5 types :
*Tisra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 3
*Chatursra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 4
*Khanda Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 5
*Misra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 7
*Sankeerna Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 9

All other rhythmic combinations can be created by a mix of these 5 Jaatis. Vinyasam, or rhythmic exploration of a musical phrase, also called Niraval uses different combinations of jaatis to create aesthetically beautiful variations. It needs to be borne in mind that in the process, the meaning and the beauty lyrics / poetry should not be spoilt. It is also important to take note of *Hrasva* (short syllables) and *Deergha* (long syllables), for elongating a short syllable could either completely change the meaning of the word, or render it meaningless. *Sahitya Bhav* or the Spirit of the Composition is a very important consideration - at all times keeping the structure, meaning and beauty of the composition while musically and rhythmically exploring it is very important.

In today's common parlance, this section is also known as *Bandish* or *Kriti*. This can include the following stages:

* *Pallavi* or *Sthayi* - introductory lines showcasing the Raga structure.
* *Anupallavi* or *Antaraa* - bridge lines which connect two sections, or two halves of the octave.
* *Charanam* or *Sanchari* - a footnote or concluding part which again covers the whole Raga.
* *Anucharanam* or *Abhog* - an optional additional section of Sanchari which contains the composer's signature.

*Pallavi* is a concatenation of **Pa**dam, **La**yam, **Vi**nyasam. It is poetry set to a metre or a Tala. Alternate names are *Bandish* (bound or pre-composed), *Kriti*.

*Anupallavi* a sub-section of pallavi which connects Pallavi to the next section Charnam. Anupallavi is also known as *Antaraa*.

*Charanam* footnote section or the concluding section of a composition. This section is also known as *Sanchari* (musically, moving all over the range of Raga). Sometimes there is a subsection called *Abhog* or *Anucharanam* which is also a form of sanchari, but it contains the composer's signature.

This four part composition is the post-Adhara Shadaj version of Udgraha, Melapaka, Dhruva and Abhog of the pre-Adhara Shadaj era called Prabandha style of compositions.
