In this session, I present *Raga Shukla Bilawal* on Chandraveena. Shukla Bilawal is a morning Raga and belongs to the Bilawal family of Ragas. This is what is called a Bhashanga Raga - one in which a note from outside the main family Raga is used. The beauty of the Raga lies in the *vakra* (zig zag) use of "outside note, Komal Nishad".

Here, I explore the Raga extensively in Alap, Jod and Jhala, and conclude with a Pallavi in Chautala. I am privileged to be accompanied by Pandit Sanjay Agle for the Pallavi session.

Sanjay Agle is a master Pakhawaj player coming from a family and tradition of Pakhawaj players. His grandfather Ambadas Agle was a legendary pakhawaj player. Sanjay Agle learnt from his father Kalidas Agle, and another renowned pakhawaj player Swami Pagaldas. His sister Chitrangana is also a very well known Pakhawaj player.

Pallavi, Bandish, Gat, Kriti etc are the different names by which a melodic line bound by a Tala cycle are known. In some cases, lyrics are set to melody and Tala of the chosen Raga and Tala, whereas in some cases its just a melodic line (comprising of swaras or notes) called *Swarajati* or *Gat* set to a chosen Tala. Many instrumental compositions offer the flexibility of setting a melodic line to a Tala, not bound by words or lyrics. This gives an opportunity to make the most of "playing with rhythm".

In this particular composition, the Pallavi takes off (known as the *Uthao* or *Eduppu*) on the 7th beat. Now try to follow the rest of the composition, as melodic phrases are created approaching *Sama* or beat 1 of the Tala cycle. While most of the melodic patterns are off-beats, yet, the final phrase comes on the Sama with a subtle intonation. This can be quite challenging for the both the artists (the melodic artist and the percussionist), since even small errors on either will result in out of sync arrival at Sama.

In my view, Tala is not about beats or the pulse points or *avartan* (Tala cycle), but the space and the timing between the beats. What kind of melodic magic can i weave in the given space is a continuous challenge. Does one need to come to Sama every avartan? Not necessarily. Once the melodic and the rhythmic framework has been established, one is free to explore melodic phrases within a rhythmic framework. Does one need to always end with a Tihai (3 times repetition of a phrase)? Again, not necessarily. Thats just mathematics. If it comes along the way of creating melodic magic, then its ok, but it is not a necessity. One can in a very inconspicous way reach Sama, and still sound beautiful. Aesthetics takes precedence, always!

Now enjoy the music!

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Shukla Bilawal
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Shukla Bilawal

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha ni Ni

**Family** - Bilawal

**Melakarta** - Bhashanga Janya Raga of 29th Melakarta Raga Shankarabharanam (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha Ni), Bhashanga note - komal ni

**Prahar** - 1st and 2nd prahar (equivalent to  6AM - 12 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha and Ni above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., na and ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Bhashanga Janya Raga
A *Janya* (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, ni is outside of Shankarabharanam (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha Ni).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | KiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
