Raga Bageshri is a very popular and beautiful Raga, usually sung in the late evening or night. Sometimes, changing a single note changes the entire character of a Raga, so much so that it feels like a completely different Raga. One such Raga is Komal Rishab Bageshri. As the name suggests, Raga Bageshri has been modified by changing the Tivra Rishab to Komal Rishab (flattened Re). I present the Raga as a Janya (derivative) of Todi.

PS : Late Pt Ravi Shankar has played a similar scale and called it Raga Parameshwari.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Komal Rishabh Bageshri
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

### Pallavi (composition) in Komal Rishabh Bageshri set to Tivratala (7 beats) and Jhaptala (10 beats)
Pallavi is a melodic phrase or lyrics set to a fixed set of beats in a rhythmic cycle. The improvisation here is creating interesting rhythm based melodic patterns while maintaining the framework of the Raga. This part of the performance is accompanied by Pakhawaj. 

### Notes on the Raga

**Raga** - Komal Rishabh Bageshri

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Dha ni

**Family** - Todi  (Jod Raga formed by combining Raga Todi (Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni) and Raga Bageshri (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni))

**Melakarta** - Varja Raga of Natakapriya (Sa re ga ma Pa Dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 9 AM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalised first letter.

**Varja Raga :** A Janya (derivative) Raga of a Melakartha in which  a note is dropped from the parent  Melakartha notes. In this, Raga, Pancham has been dropped.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
