description: "For those who may have landed here, this post is about the practical demonostration of attributes of Chandraveena. Chandraveena is a modern string instrument, structurally based on the Saraswati Veena, but designed and built to reflect my musical identity and values. I play the Chandraveena according to the traditional principles of Indian Raga system and the philosophy of Maarga Sangeet. This instrument was designed by me, and the first prototype was built my instrument maker, the Late Mohan Lal Sharma from Kolkata."

Musical instruments change and evolve to keep pace with the changes in music... Chandraveena is one such instrument born out of my musical necessity. If you want to know the motivation for ["Why Chandraveena"](/blog/why-chandraveena) or the story of ["The Making of Chandraveena"](/blog/making-of-chandraveena), please read the linked posts.

Here I would like to present the Story of Chandraveena purely from a musical perspective, and compare it with Saraswati Veena from which it was derived. I will play Raga Hamsadhwani on both the instruments, compare the instruments side-by-side and try to demonstrate how the design of Chandraveena has enabled by musical style.

The Story of Chandraveena by S Balachander

S Balachander narrates the musical story of Chandraveena and how it compares with Saraswati Veena by means of practical demonstration in Raga Hamsadhwani. He also compares the instruments side-by-side and shows how the design of Chandraveena has enabled his musical style.

Raga Alapana in Hamsadhwani
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

Raga - Hamsadhwani
Scale -  Sa Re Ga Pa Ni
Family - Kalyan
Melakartha - Kalyani
Prahar - 5th Prahar (6 pm - 9 pm)

Reading the scale: In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

Prahar: In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
