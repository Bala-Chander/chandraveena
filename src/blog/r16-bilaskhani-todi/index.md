Bilas Khan, was a famed singer, son and disciple of Tansen. Bilaskhani Todi is often attributed to Bilas Khan as the creator of the Raga. The story goes that when Tansen died, Bilas Khan sang this Raga so emotionally and beautifully that Tansen stirred! And it came to be called Bilaskhani Todi.

Let us first look at the basic scale of the Raga. Please refer to the Program Notes below for the notation.

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni

Now for the facts. As per most records, [Tansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tansen) died in 1586. Indian musical system was highly evolved by then. We already had a sophisticated [Jati-Murchhana system](/blog/grammar-of-music/) of music, through which many *jatis* (modern day Raga equivalent) were created. The scale of *Bilaskhani Todi* is the first Murchhana of [*Shadaj Gram*](https://puretones.sadharani.com/musicalscales/) - by simply moving the *Graha* (home note or starting note) to *Rishab* of Shadaj Gram (Re ga ma Pa Dha ni Sa Re, when moved to Sa will be Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni). It seems highly unlikely to me that Indian musical system was unaware of this scale. In my understanding, what could have happened is the following. Bilas Khan was definitely a very acclaimed musician, and it is possible that on his father's death, he did sing a very moving Todi, and as an honor to his singing, it was called Bilaskhani Todi.

This scale is one of the *desya* ragas mentioned in Southern India literature, and has always been just called Todi. The melakarta name for nomenclature purposes is called Hanumatodi.

I am privileged to be accompanied by Pandit Sanjay Agle for the Pallavi session.

Sanjay Agle is a master Pakhawaj player coming from a family and tradition of Pakhawaj players. His grandfather Ambadas Agle was a legendary pakhawaj player. Sanjay Agle learnt from his father Kalidas Agle, and another renowned pakhawaj player Swami Pagaldas. His sister Chitrangana is also a very well known Pakhawaj player.

## Program Notes

### Pallavi (composition) in Raga Bilaskhani Todi set to Chautala
Pallavi is a melodic phrase or lyrics set to a fixed set of beats in a rhythmic cycle. The improvisation here is creating interesting rhythm based melodic patterns while maintaining the framework of the Raga. This part of the performance is accompanied by Pakhawaj.

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Bilaskhani Todi

**Scale** - Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Todi

**Melakarta** - Hanumatodi (Sa re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 1st prahar (equivalent to 6 AM - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. This scale does not have any Tivar notes. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., re and ga above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.

### About the Tala
Chautala has 12 beats split as 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 denoted by solfas or syllables representing various rhythmic patterns. The basic solfas of Chautala are given below.

**Tala** - Chautala

**Beats** - 12 (4+4+2+2)

**Solfas** - Dha Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa |
