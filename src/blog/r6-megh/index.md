There are many systems of Raga classifcation in Indian Classical Music. Some of them are Raga - Ragini, Melakarta, Janka-Janya Thaat etc. These different systems enables a musician to understand the melodic structure of a Raga based on its heritage and association. Raga-Ragini system of classification is one of oldest classification system. This system consisted of Six principal Ragas, namely, Bhairav, Hindol, Shree, Megh, Deepak and Malkauns. There is also a metaphysical association here - some say that the first 5 Ragas came from Lord Shiva, and the sixth, Raga Malkauns, from Goddess Parvati. 

Be that as may, Raga Megh is a very grand Raga, generally considered a cooling Raga, and associated with monsoon. Many traditional lyrical compositions talk of dark clouds, thunder and lightning. Given the description, use of appropriate Gamakas (Intonations) embellishes the Raga. There are also Ragmala paintings (traditional miniature paintings on silk depicting Indian Ragas, along with a description of the Ragas) on Raga Megh.

In this session, I present *Raga Megh* on Chandraveena. I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Megh
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Megh

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa ni

**Family** - Kanada

**Melakarta** - Natabhairavi (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - Anytime during monsoon, 3rd and 4th prahar (equivalent to 12 PM - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Re above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
