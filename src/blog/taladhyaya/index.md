description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my understanding of Indian Rhythmic System. Read on to find out more!"

Rhythm is an integral part of nature. Our breathing, pulse rate, swaying of a pendulum are all governed by a certain rhythmic structure. As such it is only natural that rhythm is part of music, be it folk or classical music. Indian Classical Music has a very evolved rhythmic system developed over centuries as music itself progressed.

There are two aspects to Indian Rhythmic system, *kala* meaning time or interval and *tala* meaning cycle of beats. The word Tala probably originates from its meaning of clapping hands together, as you may have noticed many musicians keeping track of rhythm cycle through hand gestures and clapping of palms. 

The loud gesture of either through clapping of two palms, or a palm on a thigh is called *Sasabda* - keeping beats with a loud sound. The gesture of keeping beats by counting fingers is called *Nissabda* - keeping beats without sound. Often, a combination of Sasabda and Nissabda divisions are used to track the progress of a Tala.

So what does all this mean in the practical world of Indian Classical Music ? Every rhythmic cycle has a starting point (*Sama*), a half way point (*Aradhi*), beats of emphasis (Sasabda beat) and beats of silence (Nissabda). 

For eg, lets take one of the common Talas I have used in my compositions, and understand the structure. The Tala is called *Chautala*, its a 12 beat cycle. If we look at it in rhythmic solfas, they woud be :

*Dha Dha Dhin Ta | Kita Dha Dhin Ta | ThiTa KatTa | GaDhi GaNa*   

As you can see, it is divided into 4 (Char) parts seperated by | for your reference, hence the name Chau, and *tala* are the 4 points of emphasis. The division of this Tala is 4 + 4 + 2 + 2. The beats of emphasis or Sasabda are 1, 5, 9 and 11, the other beats are Nissabda. 

Often, compositions would start on the 9th beat, would arrive at the first beat (*Sama*) with an emphasis, and continue till the 8th beat. 

We now look at them in the context of a Pallavi / Bandish / Kriti / Gat. In case you havent already read, please read my post on Pallavi [here](/blog/pallavi). A musical composition has many parts:

1. A point of emphasis where a lyrical line or para starts - called *Eduppu* or *Uthao*.

2. A point of emphasis where lyrical line or para ends - called *Aradhi* (half way point of the cycle) or *Sama* (start of the cycle).

3. A musical structure in line with the rhythmic structure. This means points of musical / lyrical emphasis will also typically be Sasabda points.

Sometimes, as a play with rhythm, compositions start before a beat of emphasis, or end after a beat of emphasis. Starting or ending a composition before a point of emphasis is called an *Anagat* composition. Starting or ending a composition after a point of emphasis is called an *Agat* composition. Usually, it is one beat earlier or after. 

To make this more exciting, some compositions are designed to start / end half a beat before or after. Why is this important and exciting ? Because, every rhythmic / musical improvisation will have to follow this time signature. For eg, in Chautala, one could also start a composition at 8-1/2 or 9-1/2, thats easy enough, but the challenge is in every improvisation ending in a way so the composition can start at 8-1/2 or 9-1/2. 

There is a concept of *Tihai* which means repeating a musical / rhythmic phrase three times. Now consider that this phrase has to end half a beat before or after the point of emphasis. You can now imagine the mathematical complexity that can happen, not to mention that all along musical / textual characteristics of the Raga / Pallavi need to be maintained.

Basic divisions of the *kala* or time interval between beats are of 5 types :

*Tisra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 3

*Chatursra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 4

*Khanda Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 5

*Misra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 7

*Sankeerna Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 9

These can be then doubled or halved in speed. So you can see who quickly rhythmic complexity can get compounded with all these variations and aspects available. An expert artist not only has command over lakshana or grammar, but also lakshya - needs to combine all this and present an aesthetically pleasing musical performance along with maintaing the mood of the Raga and the Composition.

There are many Talas like Aditala (8 beats), Jhaptala (10 beats), MishraChapu (7 beats) etc. But fundamentally, they will have a structure similar to as described above with Sasabda beats and Nissabda beats dividing the Tala.

This is just a glimpse into the world of Indian rhythmic system, and hope it gives that extra bit you need to further enjoy the music.
