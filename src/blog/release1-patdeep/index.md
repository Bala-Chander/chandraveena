In this session, I present *Raga Patdeep* on Chandraveena. Raga Patdeep is a vikrut or an altered Raga belonging to the Palasi family of Ragas. The altered note is Nishad. Here, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Patdeep
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Patdeep

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - Palasi (Sa Re ga ma Pa ni). The altered note is Nishad (from komal ni to Tivra ni). It also has an additional note in Dhaivat (Dha)

**Melakartha** - Bhashanga Raga of Raga Kharaharapriya (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni)

**Prahar** - 4th prahar (equivalent to 3 PM - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Vikrit Raga
A vikrit Raga is a Raga in which one of the notes is altered from the original family scale. In this case, Palasi family uses komal ni whereas though structurally Patdeep resembles Palasi family, it uses Tivra Ni.

### Bhashanga Raga 
A Janya (or derivative) Raga of a Melakartha which uses a note outside of the Melakartha notes. In this raga, Ni is outside of Kharaharapriya (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
