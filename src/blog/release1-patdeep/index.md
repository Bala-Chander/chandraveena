In this session, I present *Raga Patdeep* on Chandraveena. Raga Patdeep is a *Vikrit* or an altered Raga belonging to the Palasi family of Ragas. The altered note is Nishad. Here, I explore the Raga in Alap, Jod and Jhala.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Patdeep
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Patdeep

**Scale** - Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - A Vikrit Raga belonging to the family of Palasi (Sa Re ga ma Pa ni). The altered note is Nishad (from ni to Ni). It also has an additional note of Dhaivat (Dha).

**Melakarta** - Bhashanga Raga of Raga Kharaharapriya (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni)

**Prahar** - 4th prahar (equivalent to 3 PM - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Dha and Ni above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ga and ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Vikrit Raga
A *Vikrit* Raga is a Raga in which one of the notes is altered from the original family scale. In this case, *Palasi* family uses ni whereas, Patdeep uses Ni, even though it resembles Palasi family, structurally.

### Bhashanga Raga
A *Janya* (or derivative) Raga of a Melakarta which uses a note outside of the Melakarta notes. In this raga, Ni is outside of Kharaharapriya (Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
