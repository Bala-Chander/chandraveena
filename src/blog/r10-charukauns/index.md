A very important fundamental concept of Indian Classical Music is the differentiation between a Scale (Melakarta / Murchhana) and Melody (Raga / Jati). While a Scale is represented by a collection of Consonant notes, a Raga derived from a Scale is defined by its Grammar and Characteristics, known as [Lakshanas and Lakshyas](/blog/grammar-of-music).

When I sat down for this recording session, I felt inspired by the rendering of Raga Ragavardhani by Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar (Rudra Veena). Ragavardhani, 32nd Melakarta is a Sampoorna Raga. The scale of the Melakarta is **Sa ga Ga ma Pa dha ni**. However, in this rendition, Dagar Saheb approaches the Raga from a Kaushiki perspective.

The scale of Charukesi, 26th Melakarta, is **Sa Re Ga ma Pa dha ni**. Using the same scale, in this rendition, I have approached the Raga from a Kaushiki / Panchamkauns perspective. Here, I present Raga Alapana in 3 parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala, also known as Alapana and Tanam.

At the end of the recording, I hadnt yet formed an identity or name for the Raga. On further inspection, I found a recording of Pandit Ravi Shankar on Sitar taking a similar approach to this scale, and he had named it Charukauns. As a mark of respect to this great musician, I have retained the name as Charukauns.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Charukauns
Raga Alapana is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. It has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

### About the Raga

**Raga** - Charukauns

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Pa dha ni

**Family** - Vakra Vikrit Raga of Kaushiki (Sa Re ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Melakarta** - Charukesi (Sa Re Ga ma Pa dha ni)

**Prahar** - 6th Prahar (equivalent to 9 PM - 12 AM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes. E.g., Ga above. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma and ni above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalised first letter.

**Vakra Raga** - A Janya (derivative) Raga of a Melakarta (parent scale) in which phrases are taken in a zig zag fashion.

*Vikrit Raga** - A Janya (derivative) Raga in which a modified note is used from a family scale. In this case, ga (komal ga) from Kaushiki is modified to Ga (Tivra Ga).

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
