*Raga Shankarabharanam* has been described by Somanatha (a 17th century musicologist) as Shiva himself dancing, in red silk, ashes on forehead and lotus garlands round his neck. *Shankara* *Bharana* literally means embellishments of Shankara - another name for Lord Shiva. 

So much for mythology, now, let us first look at the basic scale of the Raga. Please refer to the Program Notes below for the notation.

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni

Now for the facts. This is clearly one of the oldest scales in Indian classical music. We already had a sophisticated [Jati-Murchhana system](/blog/grammar-of-music/) of music, through which many *jatis* (modern day Raga equivalents) were created. The scale of *Shankarabharanam* is the *Nishad* *Murchhana* of [*Shadaj Gram*](https://puretones.sadharani.com/musicalscales/). In other words, it can be derived by simply moving the *Graha Swara* (home note or starting note) to the *Nishad* of Shadaj Gram. This murchhana, "ni Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni", when moved to Sa becomes "Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni". 

It is the 29th Melakarta in the 72 Melkarta system of Raga Classification. Its Western equivalent scale is the Major scale. In Northern parts of India, *Raga Bilawal* has a similar scale. To the best of my quest, I haven't found the name *Bilawal* mentioned in any of the early scriptures on Indian music. However, there is a scale mentioned called *Velavali*. Some are of the opinion that Bilawal is Velavali. How is that? India is a vast country with diverse culture and languages. In some parts of Indian, **व** (Va) and **ब** (Ba) are used interchangeably. For instance, in parts of India **वीणा** (Veena)  and  **बीणा** (Beena) are used to mean the same instrument, which eventually has also been called **बीन** (Been) which today means the Rudra Veena.

So, its highly possible that due to regional eccentricities, Velavali became Bilawal. However, as of now, I do not have enough information on the scale of Velavali to say for sure. When I do have more information, I will update the post.

In keeping with the grandness of this Raga, I present a detailed Alap in Raga Shankarabharanam. Enjoy the music.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Shankarabharanam

Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Shankarabharanam

**Scale** - Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni

**Family** - Shankarabharanam

**Melakarta** - Dheera Shankarabharanam (Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 3rd and 4th prahar (equivalent to 12 PM  - 6 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes, for eg., Ga , Dha. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
