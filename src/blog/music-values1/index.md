## Introduction

Neuroscientists around the world have been studying the workings of musicians’ brains for decades now. During these investigations, they have discovered unusual patterns, parts of brain firing up, defying conventional understanding of human brain. As some say, its fireworks happening. Guess what ? We already know we are unusual!

I am an Indian Classical Musician, an inventor and performing artist of Chandraveena. In a parallel avatar, I was also a Corporate Manager. Having worked at leadership positions in the corporate world, and as a performing artist of Indian Classical Music, I am fortunate to have experienced both worlds. 

> Music and the professional world have more in common than one may think.

As a student of music in a traditional system, I imbibed values beyond just the training in music, principles and philosophy to a way of life. 

Lets look at the value systems I gained as a musician which have equal relevance in the corporate world.

## Value systems

**Team work** is the hallmark of any good musical presentation. A Symphony or an orchestra of 100 musicians performing is at its best when every musician is in complete sync with the others. I have been on both sides of the table, as a witness to a Symphony of 100 musicians performing, and as a performing artist myself. 

As a performing artist, every time I go on stage with my accompanying musicians, we work together on and off stage, to present a cohesive and an enjoyable musical performance.

Every endeavours’ success depends on :   
1. Mutual understanding between the team members
2. Everyone in the team playing their roles
3. All working in sync with each other

**Individual development** is the key to creating a powerful performer and a future leader. During the early days of my musical training, it was a lot of hard technical training and following my Guru. 

As I got better, I was constantly encouraged to think for myself, to find my own musical style and path. This training made me to think for myself, understand myself and forge my own path.

We are as individual as our fingerprints, moulded by our education, experiences, personality traits etc. We are our best in our own skin. This skill enables one to:   
1. Take the best of others experiences
2. Use his own thinking and experiences
3. Create a path for going forward

**Empathy** is the sensitivity to another persons’ situation, to sensitise oneself to humanity. How does this aspect come from music ? 

For one, music is a collection of notes or melody, but it also needs to create an emotional reaction in the listeners. This also demands that the performer be able to emote, for how else are we going to get any reaction from our listeners! Years of creating music and emoting has developed an inner sensitivity, a sensitivity to situations around, the ability to understand and feel for another.

Empathy and compassion are basic emotional needs of every human. This builds:  
1. Mutual respect
2. Trust
3. Understanding and cooperation

**Creative thinking** is fundamental to creating good music. Indian Classical Music has been around for centuries, musicians have been singing / playing the same Scale / Raga for centuries, and yet, they survive, yet people throng to hear.

Constantly thinking of different ways to work with a Scale / Raga or a Tala / Rhythm sharpens the ability to make something new, to look at the same Raga/Scale from a different perspective. Our brains are constantly buzzing with ideas. 

This training in turn builds the skill to :   
1. Think differently
2. Create new ideas and innovations
3. Solve problems where there isn’t an obvious solution

## Conclusion

Team work, Self development, Empathy and Compassion, and Creative thinking are skills and values that are applicable to almost any field. Practice makes one perfect, right? Constantly engaged in these values not only makes one good at these, but, they become a way of life, a way where these skills instinctively kick-in in any situation.
