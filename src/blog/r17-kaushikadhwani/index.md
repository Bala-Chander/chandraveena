Indian Raga system, since centuries have been associated with Nature. There are seasonal Ragas (like Malhar - monsoon, Basant - spring etc). then there are time bound Ragas which are based on Sun/Moon movements, like early morning Ragas Todi , Bhairav, late evening Ragas like Puriya, Yaman, Night Ragas such as Bageshri, Kanada etc.

Raga Kaushika Dhwani gives a feeling of spring time, leaves rustling, birds chirping etc. In the same spirit, this high quality recording has been done in natural surroundings. You will hear the birds chirping, koel (cuckoo) calling, maybe even the leaves rustling, and an ocassional dog barking!

Let us first look at the basic scale of the Raga. Please refer to the Program Notes below for the notation.

**Scale** - Sa Ga ma Dha Ni

I present a Raga Alapana in three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala also known as Alapana and Tanam. In this presentation of Raga Kaushika Dhwani on Chandraveena, I have employed the Alpatva (very subtle and not often used) Tivra Rishabh (Re). 

## Note on Raga Bhinna Shadja

Raga Bhinna Shadja is one of the few legacy names which represent scales from the earlier [Jati-Murchhana system](/blog/grammar-of-music/) of music, through which many *jatis* (modern day Raga equivalents) were created. Let me briefly explain the name, and how it represents the jati system.

Sangeet Ratnakar, by Sharangdev, one of the most recognised treatises on Indian music, describes 5 styles of song (*Geeti*) rendition - *Shuddha*, *Bhinna*, *Gouda*, *Vesara* and *Sadharani*. The detailed description of each of these styles is an extensive subject by itself and needs its own blog post. I will skip the description here, suffice it to say that, jatis were described by the style of its rendition along with the scale. Therefore, *Bhinna Shadja* is a scale derived from [*Shadaj Gram*](https://puretones.sadharani.com/musicalscales/), rendered in *Bhinna Geeti* style. Now, for the description of this scale as per Sangeet Ranakar:

Bhinna Shadja is described as :
 1. Dhaivata as the fundamental note
 2. Rishab and Panchama varjit (dropped notes)
 3. Antara Gandhara and Kakali Nishad to be used

Now, lets look at Shadaj Gram scale:

Sa Re ga ma Pa Dha ni

Taking Dha as a fundamental note (*Graha* note), this is what we get:

Dha ni Sa Re ga ma Pa

Tranposing this to Dha as Sa, this is what we get:

Sa re ga ma Pa(today's Ma) dha ni

Dropping Rishab and Pancham, we get:

Sa ga ma dha ni (current day Hindolam / Malkauns)

Now, using Antara Gandhara and Kakali Nishad, we get:

Sa Ga ma dha Ni

This is Raga Bhinna Shadja as per Jati system. Today, however, Bhinna Shadja is sung with Tivra Dhaivat (Dha) making the scale similar to Kaushika Dhwani. At what point in history did this change happen is not very clear. Many Ragas have gone through evolution, changed forms and taken notes different from earlier descriptions in our treatises.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Kaushika Dhwani

Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga and the Tala.

**Raga** - Kaushika Dhwani

**Scale** - Sa Ga ma Dha Ni

**Family** - Bilawal

**Melakarta** - Shankarabharanam (Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 1st prahar (equivalent to 6 PM  - 9 PM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes, for eg., Ga , Dha. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., ma above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
