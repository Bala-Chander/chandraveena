description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana is. Read on to find out more!"

A typical presentation of an Indian Classical music performance has two parts :


*Anibaddha Sangeet* - Raga Music which is not bound by lyrics, meter or tala. Eg, Raga Alapana


*Nibadhha Sangeet* - Raga Music which is bound by lyrics, meter and tala. Eg, Pallavi

Here in this post, I will talk about Raga Alapana.

*Raga Alapana* contains two words - *Raga* and *Alapana*. This begets the question - what is a *Raga*?  This is a vast subject in itself, but I will address it briefly here. A Raga is identified in terms of its Lakshana and Lakshya. You can read more about introduction to lakshana and lakshya [here](/blog/music-as-a-performing-art) and a more detailed post on lakshanas [here](/blog/grammar-of-music).

Pertaining to the Lakshya aspect, our scriptures describe a Raga as that which pleases the mind, and evokes an emotional response. However, to formalise, and bring in consistency in performaces, Lakshanagranthas have set out grammar for the presentation of Ragas. This includes the set of notes to be used in the Raga, the consonant relationship of each note with other notes, and rules regarding how a valid musical phrase can be constructed. These rules also mould the microtonal shades of notes that can be used and therefore the overall tuning of the scale of the Raga. Microtonal variations of a note is a fascinating subject in itself for another post. 

Within the framework of this grammar, a Raga presentation which can be described as *Ranjayati* (that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind) is the most important characteristic in the presentation of a Raga.

According to our scriptures, the presentation of a Raga can be through multiple forms - *Raga Alapti*, *Rupak Alapti*, *Prabandha*, *Kriti*, etc. We can consider Raga Alapti as the earliest mention of the concept of Raga Alapana. Raga Alapana is a systematic extempore exploration and presentation of a Raga, within the governing principles of Raga Lakshana. This part of the musical presentation does not have any rhythmic cycle and therefore is commonly performed without any rhythmic accompaniment. Raga Alapana uses certain syllables and vocal solfas as a means to sing which I covered in [this post](/intro/#alap) for explanation.

Alapana, Alapti and Alap are all synonymous.

## Raga Alapana

Raga Alapana can be classified into the following stages:

### Akshiptika or the Introduction

*Akshiptika* is a condensed alapana, wherein the whole identity and structure of the Raga is established quickly in a few phrases. Typically, this part of the Alapana would be in the Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). This enables fellow musicians on the stage, and listeners alike to immediately relate to the Raga being presented. The familiarity helps in following and enjoying the presentation of the Raga.

### Raga Vardhani or the main body of the Alapana

*Raga Vardhani* is the biggest part of Alapana. This in turn consists of 4 stages.

* Stage 1 of the alapana starts with Madhya Sthayi Shadaj (the fundamental of the middle octave), and explores the Raga in Mandra Sthayi (lower octave) and Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). Here, the identity of the Raga is further established through the usage of appropriate phrases, intonations and note emphasis points.
* Stage 2 of the alapana consists of exploring the Raga in all its nuances, a note by note exploration, giving full freedom to the creative process. Ocassionally, the phrases may touch Tara Sthayi (higher octave), but predomoinantly restricted to lower and middle octave.
* In Stage 3, most of the exploration happens in the higher octave, ocassionally coming down to the middle octave.
* Stage 4 is the concluding part where *sancharis* (phrases) across all 3 octaves are presented. This part maybe in a slightly faster tempo compared to the earlier stages.

### Vartani or Madhyamakala (also popularly known as Tanam or Jod/Jhala)

In this section, there is a perceptible pulse in the singing or playing. On an instrument like Veena, the *Chikari/Talam* strings provide a sense of rhythm to the melodic phrases. This section is usually in medium tempo - and hence the name *Madhyamakala* (middle tempo). This section is also performed in *Drutakala* or fast tempo, and referred to as *Ghanam* or *Jhala*.

### Nyasa or the conclusion, also known as Muktayi

This is the concluding part, where *sancharis* or melodic phrases across the octaves are presented, in a continuous movement providing a climax to the whole Raga Alapana. This ends the section Raga Alapana.

Raga Alapana is classified as *Manodharma Sangeet* (Mano - of the mind, imagination. Dharma - Rules / Conduct. Raga improvisation by the artists' imagination, within the framework / rules of the Raga).
