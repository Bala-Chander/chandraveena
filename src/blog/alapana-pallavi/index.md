The term Classical in Indian Classical Music is kind of a misnomer, in the sense, it doesnt represent a period music. Unlike Western music evolution which had classifications of type of music based on periods - Gregorian Chants, Baroque, Renaissance, Classical, Modern, Contemporary etc, Indian music has been one of continuous evolution over a period of 1500 years. While evolution and changes happened, many of the fundamental principles of Raga music have been around for many centuries. The appropriate terminology for Indian Classical Music would be Shastriya Sangeet - music based on Shastras or Scriptures. All Indian performing arts of have aspects - Lakshya (presentation) and Lakshan (Grammar). The scriptures realted to Lakshan are called Lakshangrantha (Book of Grammar). Few examples of Lakshangrantha related to music are Sangeet Ratnakar, Dattilam, Svaramelakalanidhi, Chaturdandi Prakasika etc. These books have been written by eminent scholar musician musicologists like Sarangdev, Dattil, Ramaamatya, Venkatmakhin etc.

Many of you may have already noticed that all my releases on my YouTube and Bandcamp channel have Raga Alapana and Pallavi tagged to the tracks. In this post, I explore the meaning and grammar of Raga Alapana and Pallavi, based on my study of scriptures, and practical musical understanding.

## Raga Alapana

The first question to address here would be what is a Raga ? This is a vast subject in itself, but I'll address it briefly here. Is it defined by ascending / descending notes ? Or by Vadi Samvadi ? or Pakad ? According to our scriptures, Raga is that which pleases the mind, and evokes an emotional response. In my opinion, shouldnt that be the definition of any music ? Lakshanagranthas have set out a grammar, like any other language, so that there is an identity and consistency in the presentation of a Raga. It would be quite a disaster if for eg, Raga Hamasadhvani uses different sets of notes in different parts of the country, isnt it ? Within the framework of this grammar, Ranjayati - that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind - is the most important principle in the presentation of a Raga.

According to some of our scriptures, presentation of a Raga can be through multiple forms - Raga Alapti, Rupak Alapti, Prabandha, Kriti etc. Here we consider Raga Alapti - the earliest mention of Raga Alapana.
