description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana and Pallavi is. Read on to find out more!"

If I say "Indian Classical Music", I am quite sure you know what form of music I am referring to. However, the term *Classical* in Indian Classical Music is a bit of a misnomer.

In Western [Art Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_music), the term *Classical* can be applied in two ways. In a strict sense, it refers to music of the [Classical period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music)), while in a broader sense it refers to music rooted in [classical traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music) but including music from before the Classical period all the way up to its Contemporary forms.

In Indian Art Music, there is no specific Classical period. Rather the [story of Indian music](/blog/history-of-indian-music/) has been one of continuous evolution over a period of 1500 years. Despite many changes and a long evolution, many of the fundamental principles of Indian Ragas and Raga-based music have been around for many centuries. A more appropriate term for Indian Classical Music would be *Shastriya Sangeet* or music based on *Shastras* (scriptures).

All Indian performing arts (music, dance, drama, etc) have two major aspects - *Lakshya* (presentation) and *Lakshana* (grammar). A scripture related to *Lakshana* is referred to as a *Lakshanagrantha* (book of grammar). A few examples of Lakshangranthas related to music are *Sangeet Ratnakar*, *Dattilam*, *Svaramelakalanidhi*, *Chaturdandi Prakasika*, etc. These books have been written by eminent scholars, musicians and musicologists like *Sarangdev*, *Dattil*, *Raamamatya*, *Venkatmakhin*, among others.

Many of you may have already noticed that all my releases on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPyMV4LS9YBePXM0mV4hjg"><inline-button background="#ff0000">YouTube</inline-button></a> and <a href="https://chandraveena.bandcamp.com/"><inline-button background="#408294">Bandcamp</inline-button></a> channels have the terms *Raga Alapana* and *Pallavi* tagged to the tracks. In this post, I explore the meaning and grammar of Raga Alapana and Pallavi, based on my study of these scriptures, and my understanding through practicing music.

## Raga Alapana

The heading itself contains two words - *Raga* and *Alapana*. This begets the question - what is a *Raga*?  This is a vast subject in itself, but I will address it briefly here. According to our scriptures, Raga is that which pleases the mind, and evokes an emotional response. In my opinion, shouldn't that be the definition of any music? Now, Lakshanagranthas have set out a grammar so that there is an identity and consistency in the presentation of a Raga. It would be quite problematic if, for example, *Raga Hamasadhwani* used different sets of notes, in different parts of the country, wouldn't it? Within the framework of this grammar, a Raga presentation which can be described as *Ranjayati* (that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind) is the most important characteristic in the presentation of a Raga.

According to our scriptures, the presentation of a Raga can be through multiple forms - *Raga Alapti*, *Rupak Alapti*, *Prabandha*, *Kriti*, etc. We can consider Raga Alapti as the earliest mention of the concept of Raga Alapana. Raga Alapana is a systematic extempore exploration and presentation of a Raga, within the governing principles of Raga Lakshan. This part of the musical presentation does not have any rhythmic cycle and therefore is commonly performed without any rhythmic accompaniment. Raga Alapana uses certain syllables and vocal solfas as a means to sing which I covered in [this post](/intro/#alap) for explanation. Alapana, Alapti and Alap are all synonymous.

The systematic presentation, according to the scriptures can be classified into the following parts:

### Akshiptika or the Introduction

*Akshiptika* is a condensed alapana wherein the whole identity and structure of the Raga is established quickly in a few phrases. Typically, this part of the Alapana would be in the Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). This enables fellow musicians on the stage, and listeners alike to immediately relate to the Raga being presented. The familiarity helps in following and enjoying the presentation of the Raga.

### Raga Vardhani or the main body of the Alapana

*Raga Vardhani* is the biggest part of Alapana. This in turn consists of 4 stages.

* Stage 1 of the alapana starts with Madhya Sthayi Shadaj, and explores the Raga in Mandra Sthayi (lower octave) and Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). Here, the identity of the Raga is further established through the usage of appropriate phrases, intonations and note emphasis points.
* Stage 2 of the alapana consists of exploring the Raga in all its nuances, a note by note exploration, giving full freedom to the creative process. Ocassionally, the phrases may touch Tara Sthayi (higher octave), but predomoinantly restricted to lower and middle octave.
* In Stage 3, most of the exploration happens in higher octave, ocassionally coming down to middle octave.
* Stage 4 is the concluding part where *sancharis* (phrases) across all 3 octaves are presented. This part maybe in a slightly faster tempo compared to the earlier stages.

### Sthayi

Sthayi is a melodic structure where the starting note, and the ending note of the phrase are the same. In this section, a musician can pick starting notes, create a melodic phrase, and return to the starting note. Where the starting notes are in ascending form, its called *Arohana sthayi*, and where the starting notes are in descending form, its called *Avarohana sthayi*.

### Vartani or Madhyamakala (also popularly known as Tanam or Jod/Jhala)

In this section, there is a perceptible pulse in the singing or playing. On an instrument like Veena, the *Chikari/Talam* strings provide a sense of rhythm to the melodic phrases. This section is usually in medium tempo - and hence the name *Madhyamakala* (middle tempo). This section is also performed in *Drutakala* or fast tempo, and referred to as *Ghanam* or *Jhala*.

### Nyasa or the conclusion, also known as Muktayi

This is the concluding part, where *sancharis* or melodic phrases across the octaves are presented, in a continuous movement providing a climax to the whole Raga Alapana.

## Pallavi

The word Pallavi is believed to be a compound word made from 3 words: **Pa**dam, **La**yam, and **Vi**nyasam.

Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase, Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana. This was also known as Rupak Alapti in early texts on Indian music.

The musical phrase is set in a way such that there are certain emphasis points in the rhythmic cycle, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase in the rhythmic cycle. For eg, in a cycle of 12 beats, the starting point of the Padam maybe on the 9th beat, the emphasis point on the 1st beat, and the end point on the 8th beat. One generally tries to keep this basic structure intact, and explore the musical phrase rhythmically.


## Summary
To summarise, a Raga is a musical structure which should be presented according to its prescribed Lakshanas. Raga Alapana is a prescribed method for presenting a Raga systematically. Pallavi is a further exploration of the Raga together with a rhythmic cycle and its rhythmic accents. While adhering to these aspects of presentation, a musician should aspire to please the listeners' minds and evoke an emotional response from them.

This post is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it provides a glimpse into the process of Raga Alapana and Pallavi. I also hope that this would enable you to follow and enjoy Chandraveena music and Indian Classical music in general.
