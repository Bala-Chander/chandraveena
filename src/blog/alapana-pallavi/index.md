description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana and Pallavi is. Read on to find out more!"

If I say "Indian Classical Music", I am quite sure you know what form of music I am referring to. However, the term *Classical* in Indian Classical Music is a bit of a misnomer.

In Western [Art Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_music), the term *Classical* can be applied in two ways. In a strict sense, it refers to music of the [Classical period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_period_(music)), while in a broader sense it refers to music rooted in [classical traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music) but including music from before the Classical period all the way up to its contemporary forms.

However, in Indian Art Music, there is no specific Classical period. Rather the [story of Indian music](/blog/history-of-indian-music/) has been one of continuous evolution over a period of 1500 years. Despite many changes and a long evolution, many of the fundamental principles of Indian Ragas and Raga-based music have been around for many centuries. A more appropriate term for Indian Classical Music would be *Shastriya Sangeet* or music based on *Shastras* (scriptures).

All Indian performing arts (music, dance, drama, etc) have two major aspects - *Lakshya* (presentation) and *Lakshana* (grammar). A scripture related to *Lakshana* is referred to as a *Lakshanagrantha* (book of grammar). A few examples of Lakshangranthas related to music are *Sangeet Ratnakar*, *Dattilam*, *Svaramelakalanidhi*, *Chaturdandi Prakasika*, etc. These books have been written by eminent scholars, musicians and musicologists like *Sarangdev*, *Dattil*, *Raamamatya*, *Venkatmakhin*, among others.

Our music was not always like we know and understand today. As music evolved, many great musicians and musicologists have played a role in contributing to the Indian Classical Music as we know it today. Lakshana and Lakshaya go hand in hand. In some instances lakshana was formed after lakshya to give a framework, and in other instances, lakshya follows lakshana. To have a full command over Indian Classical Music, I feel it is imperative to have a proper understanding of both lakshya and lakshana for a lack of one will lead to misinterpretation of the other.

As a natural part of evolution, certain aspects of lakshya and lakshana were modified, some new forms came in place, some forms became obsolete, certain terminologies were carried over with a different context etc. In my opinion, the introduction of the concept of *Adhara Shadaj* (reference tonic note) was a turning point in our music. According to my understanding, this is likely to have happened between 13th century - 16 century. It is not yet clear to me what led to the change, or what were the influences, but music changed so much so that I would actually classify Indian Classical Music as pre-Adhara Shadaj era and post-Adhara Shadaj era. Pre-Adhara Shadaj era music was based on Murchchana (Scales) and Jatis (modes), a system in which every scale change gave rise to a new Jati or melody. Post-Adhara Shadaj era, as we know it today, is based on performing a musical scale to a single reference tonic note. As such, the concept of scale change became irrelevant. Ragas, as the Jatis now are known, are classified in a variety of ways - Raga / Ragini system, Melakartha system, Janaka / Janya system, Thaat system etc. The system to follow to some extent depends on the school/style of music wherein the artist has been trained, and partly also the artists' choice. The system of Raga and Raga classification is outside the purview of this article, and is a vast subject in itself.

Lets take few examples of lashanas (grammar), and see what they mean.

*Graha* (Home) swar was a very important concept in the pre-Adhara Shadaj days. Why ? Because the music was based on *Jatis* (modes) derived from Murchhana (scale). Every mode had a starting note, infact, starting note defined the mode, and hence the importance as a home note. However, in the post-Adhara Shadaj era, all Ragas are being sung to a single reference note Sa, ineffect Sa being the Graha note for all Ragas making it irrelevant. The most often used note is called *Amsa*. Amsa literally mans shoulder or a bull's hump, musically, it means the note that shoulders the weight of the Raga.

As Raga music evolved, in today's music *Vadi* denotes the most important note of the Raga, and *Samvadi* as the second most important note of the Raga. I am of a different opinion based on my reading of both pre-Adhara Shadaj scriptures and post-Adhara Shadaj scriptures. *Vadi* means a speaking note, for every note of a Raga is a Vadi note. Samvadi is a consonant note of the Vadi note - which will be 4th (madhyama bhav) or the 5th (pancham bhav). 

*Anuvadi* is a note descibed as being in harmony, typically the 3rd (tivra gandhara bhav) of a note. *Vivadi* is incorrectly understood as banned note. Far from it, vivadi notes are used. Vivadi literally means a contest or arguement. Musically it means a note so close to the original that one can contest the note. For eg, if I have a very sharp Rishab, and a very flattened komal Gandhar, one could say the two notes are Vivadi to each other. To use it musically is lakshya - the artists' ability to bring the beauty.

*Nyasa* is a halting note of a musical phrase. It could be samvadi / anuvadi of the starting note of the musical phrase, or the amsa note of the Raga. 

The dropping of notes were defined by scale characteristics - *Shadav* (hexatonic), *Audav* (pentatonic), the absence of either meant a 7 note scale. 

*Alpatva* note is one which is rarely and fleetingly used note. 

*Bahutava* note is one which is often used. Graha, Amsa notes are generally Bahutva notes.

*Hrasva* note is one on which musical phrase doesnt linger for long periods of time.

*Deergha* note is one where a musical phrase can halt for considerable time.

Hrasva and Deergha are also applicable in compositions where they mean short vowels and long vowels.

*Sthayi* today denotes an octave. However, *Sthayi* literally means constant, musically, it means a fixed note around which musical phrases revolve. Now, if you take Sa as the Sthayi note, you can see how it can easily denote an octave, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa' (octave Sa, or Tara Sa or as is correctly called *Dviguna* swar). There are many ways in which sthayi can be formed. For eg : Sa Re Sa, Sa Re Sa', Sa Ma Pa Sa, Sa' Pa Ma Sa etc (Sa - middle octave, Sa' - higher octave)... Infact, I have here taken Sa as an example, it can be any note as long as the rule is followed. Sthayi is used in the context of a musical phrase, in Raga Alapana and in Composition (Pallavi).


*Pallavi* is a concatenation of **Pa**dam, **La**yam, **Vi**nyasam. It is poetry set to a metre or a Tala. Alternate names are *Bandish* (bound or pre-composed), *Kriti*.

*Anupallavi* a sub-section of pallavi which connects Pallavi to the next section Charnam. Anupallavi is also known as *Antaraa*.

*Charanam* footnote section or the concluding section of a composition. This section is also known as *Sanchari* (musically, moving all over the range of Raga). Sometimes there is a subsection called *Abhog* or *Anucharanam* which is also a form of sanchari, but it contains the composer's signature.

This four part composition is the post-Adhara Shadaj version of Udgraha, Melapaka, Dhruva and Abhog of the pre-Adhara Shadaj era called Prabandha style of compositions.

Many of you may have already noticed that all my releases on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPyMV4LS9YBePXM0mV4hjg"><inline-button background="#ff0000">YouTube</inline-button></a> and <a href="https://chandraveena.bandcamp.com/"><inline-button background="#408294">Bandcamp</inline-button></a> channels have the terms *Raga Alapana* and *Pallavi* tagged to the tracks. In this post, I explore the meaning and grammar of Raga Alapana and Pallavi, based on my study of these scriptures, and my understanding through practicing music.

<br>

## Raga Alapana

The heading itself contains two words - *Raga* and *Alapana*. This begets the question - what is a *Raga*?  This is a vast subject in itself, but I will address it briefly here. As mentioned before, a Raga is identified in terms of its Lakshya and Lakshana.

Pertaining to the Lakshya aspect, our scriptures describe a Raga as that which pleases the mind, and evokes an emotional response. In my opinion, shouldn't that be the definition of any music? For the Lakshana aspect, the Lakshanagranthas have set out a grammar so that there is an identity and consistency in the presentation of a Raga. This includes the set of notes to be used in the Raga, the consonant relationship of each note with other notes, and rules regarding how valid musical phrases can be constructed. These rules also mould the microtonal shades of notes that can be used and therefore the overall tuning of the scale of the Raga. But this is a topic for another post! Within the framework of this grammar, a Raga presentation which can be described as *Ranjayati* (that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind) is the most important characteristic in the presentation of a Raga.

According to our scriptures, the presentation of a Raga can be through multiple forms - *Raga Alapti*, *Rupak Alapti*, *Prabandha*, *Kriti*, etc. We can consider Raga Alapti as the earliest mention of the concept of Raga Alapana. Raga Alapana is a systematic extempore exploration and presentation of a Raga, within the governing principles of Raga Lakshana. This part of the musical presentation does not have any rhythmic cycle and therefore is commonly performed without any rhythmic accompaniment. Raga Alapana uses certain syllables and vocal solfas as a means to sing which I covered in [this post](/intro/#alap) for explanation.

Alapana, Alapti and Alap are all synonymous. This section of a musical presentation has also been referred to in our scriptures as *Anibaddha Sangeet* (music which is unbound - by lyrics and meter, i.e., not composed).

Raga Alapana can be classified into the following stages:

### Akshiptika or the Introduction

*Akshiptika* is a condensed alapana, wherein the whole identity and structure of the Raga is established quickly in a few phrases. Typically, this part of the Alapana would be in the Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). This enables fellow musicians on the stage, and listeners alike to immediately relate to the Raga being presented. The familiarity helps in following and enjoying the presentation of the Raga.

### Raga Vardhani or the main body of the Alapana

*Raga Vardhani* is the biggest part of Alapana. This in turn consists of 4 stages.

* Stage 1 of the alapana starts with Madhya Sthayi Shadaj (the fundamental of the middle octave), and explores the Raga in Mandra Sthayi (lower octave) and Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). Here, the identity of the Raga is further established through the usage of appropriate phrases, intonations and note emphasis points.
* Stage 2 of the alapana consists of exploring the Raga in all its nuances, a note by note exploration, giving full freedom to the creative process. Ocassionally, the phrases may touch Tara Sthayi (higher octave), but predomoinantly restricted to lower and middle octave.
* In Stage 3, most of the exploration happens in the higher octave, ocassionally coming down to the middle octave.
* Stage 4 is the concluding part where *sancharis* (phrases) across all 3 octaves are presented. This part maybe in a slightly faster tempo compared to the earlier stages.

### Vartani or Madhyamakala (also popularly known as Tanam or Jod/Jhala)

In this section, there is a perceptible pulse in the singing or playing. On an instrument like Veena, the *Chikari/Talam* strings provide a sense of rhythm to the melodic phrases. This section is usually in medium tempo - and hence the name *Madhyamakala* (middle tempo). This section is also performed in *Drutakala* or fast tempo, and referred to as *Ghanam* or *Jhala*.

### Nyasa or the conclusion, also known as Muktayi

This is the concluding part, where *sancharis* or melodic phrases across the octaves are presented, in a continuous movement providing a climax to the whole Raga Alapana. This ends the section Raga Alapana.

## Pallavi

The word Pallavi is believed to be a compound word made from 3 words: **Pa**dam, **La**yam, and **Vi**nyasam.

Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase, Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana. This section of a musical presentation has also been referred to as Rupak Alapti or Nibaddha Sangeet (music which is bound - by lyrics, meter and Tala which are composed). Rupak Alapti could also be considered as the precursor to modern day *Khyal* genre of Indian Classical Music. This has two characteristics - *Dhatu* (musical aspects) and *Matu* (Poetry or Lyrical aspects). Essentially, this is poetry set to music in a tala or rhythmic cycle of beats.

These lyrics or musical phrases are set to different talas like Chautala (12 beats), Mishra Chapu (7 beats), Jhaptala (10 beats), etc. The musical phrases are typically set in a way such that they line up with specific accents in the rhythmic cycle. For example, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase should match corresponding accents in the rhythmic cycle.

Indian rhythmic system is well evolved, and has many features. In addition to a repeating cycle, emphasis points, starting and ending beat, an important aspect of Indian Tala System is Jaati (literally meaning tribe, but musically meaning to a class of beats). We recognise 5 types :
*Tisra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 3
*Chatursra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 4
*Khanda Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 5
*Misra Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 7
*Sankeerna Jaati* means musical phrases are created in multiples of 9

All other rhythmic combinations can be created by a mix of these 5 Jaatis. Vinyasam, or rhythmic exploration of a musical phrase, also called Niraval uses different combinations of jaatis to create aesthetically beautiful variations. It needs to be borne in mind that in the process, the meaning and the beauty lyrics / poetry should not be spoilt. It is also important to take note of *Hrasva* (short syllables) and *Deergha* (long syllables), for elongating a short syllable could either completely change the meaning of the word, or render it meaningless. *Sahitya Bhav* or the Spirit of the Composition is a very important consideration - at all times keeping the structure, meaning and beauty of the composition while musically and rhythmically exploring it is very important.

In today's common parlance, this section is also known as *Bandish* or *Kriti*. This can include the following stages:

* *Pallavi* or *Sthayi* - introductory lines showcasing the Raga structure.
* *Anupallavi* or *Antaraa* - bridge lines which connect two sections, or two halves of the octave.
* *Charanam* or *Sanchari* - a footnote or concluding part which again covers the whole Raga.
* *Anucharanam* or *Abhog* - an optional additional section of Sanchari which contains the composer's signature.

## Summary

To summarise, a Raga is a musical structure which should be presented according to its prescribed Lakshanas. Raga Alapana is a prescribed method for presenting a Raga systematically. Pallavi is a further exploration of the Raga together with a rhythmic cycle and its rhythmic accents. While adhering to these aspects of presentation, a musician should aspire to please the listeners' minds and evoke an emotional response from them.

This post is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it provides a glimpse into the process of Raga Alapana and Pallavi. I also hope that this would enable you to follow and enjoy Chandraveena music and Indian Classical music in general. In a subsequent video, I will give a demo of different sections of Raga Alapana and Pallavi. Stay tuned!

Based on this article, you can try and identify the different sections of the Raga Alapana. Most of my Pallavis consist of only one section. Try and identify the starting point, the emphasis point and the end point of the pallavi.

For a multi section pallavi, listen to compositions of Tansen, Baiju, Thyagaraja, Muthuswamy Diskshithar, etc. You can try and identify the different sections.
