In my long association with music, I have been very fortunate to have had some great teachers. They have been an integral part of my journey as a musician, and who I am today. In addition to studying music, they always encouraged debates, questions, discussions on music, theory of music and its history. This piqued my interest in musicology, in history and evolution of music - not just Indian music but music from around the world. This also led me to read ancient scriptures on music, and corelate the writings to my practical understanding of music. One such important topic that I am going to cover today is Raga Alapana and Pallavi.

Many of you may have already noticed that all my releases on my YouTube and Bandcamp channel have Raga Alapana and Pallavi tagged to the tracks. So, what do they really mean ? There are multitude of terminologies you may have heard - Alap, Alapana, Composition, Bandish, Jod/Jhala, Tanam etc. What do they all mean ? What role do they play in Indian Classical Music ? 

Actually, you see, the Classical part of Indian Classical Music in itself is a misnomer. Unlike Western Classical, where it denotes a period in history, we dont have a Baroque period or a Renaissance perod or a Classical period. Indian music has been a constant evolution over a period of maybe 2000 years from the early chants of Vedas to the Raga music of today. It continues to evolve. What we really mean to say by Classical is Shastriya Sangeet. Sangeet means music. What is Shastriya ? Shastriya means - subscribing to the views / rules of Shastra, and Shastras are scriptures defining dos / donts and the rules - whether be it social conduct or rituals or music.

Now, lets address the two terminologies - Raga Alapana and Pallavi - as I prefer to call them, but this applies to whatever terminology they are called. Lets take Raga Alapana. What is Alapana ? Some say its melodic improvisation, some say its an introduction to the Raga, some say its an unmetered musical phrases - so, can i sing random set of phrases in any order ? Some call Raga Alapana as Manodharma Sangeet. What does it mean ? Mano + Dharma - means follow the rules but sing from the heart. So, what are the rules ? Here is where our scriptures come in. You see, Alapana is not a random collection of phrases of a Raga sung in any order, there are norms as defined by our scriptures - and hence Shastriya Sangeet.

So, what is Raga Alapana ? What are the rules governing it as per our scriptures ? Lets take a look.
