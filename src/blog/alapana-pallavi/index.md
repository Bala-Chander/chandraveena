In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana and Pallavi is. Read on to find out more!"

The term Classical in Indian Classical Music is kind of a misnomer, in the sense, it doesnt represent a period music. Unlike Western music evolution which had classifications of type of music based on periods - Gregorian Chants, Baroque, Renaissance, Classical, Modern, Contemporary etc, Indian music has been one of continuous evolution over a period of 1500 years. While evolution and changes happened, many of the fundamental principles of Raga music have been around for many centuries. The appropriate terminology for Indian Classical Music would be Shastriya Sangeet - music based on Shastras or Scriptures. All Indian performing arts of have aspects - Lakshya (presentation) and Lakshana (Grammar). The scriptures realted to Lakshan are called Lakshangrantha (Book of Grammar). Few examples of Lakshangrantha related to music are Sangeet Ratnakar, Dattilam, Svaramelakalanidhi, Chaturdandi Prakasika etc. These books have been written by eminent scholar musician musicologists like Sarangdev, Dattil, Ramaamatya, Venkatmakhin etc.

Many of you may have already noticed that all my releases on my YouTube and Bandcamp channel have Raga Alapana and Pallavi tagged to the tracks. In this post, I explore the meaning and grammar of Raga Alapana and Pallavi, based on my study of scriptures, and practical musical understanding.

## Raga Alapana

The para title in itself contains two words - *Raga* and *Alapana*. This begets the question - what is a Raga ?  This is a vast subject in itself, but I'll address it briefly here. According to our scriptures, Raga is that which pleases the mind, and evokes an emotional response. In my opinion, shouldnt that be the definition of any music ? Lakshanagranthas have set out a grammar, like any other language, so that there is an identity and consistency in the presentation of a Raga. It would be quite a disaster if for eg, Raga Hamasadhvani uses different sets of notes in different parts of the country, isnt it ? Within the framework of this grammar, Ranjayati - that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind - is the most important component in the presentation of a Raga.

According to some of our scriptures, presentation of a Raga can be through multiple forms - Raga Alapti, Rupak Alapti, Prabandha, Kriti etc. Here we consider Raga Alapti - the earliest mention of Raga Alapana. Raga Alapana is a systematic extempore exploration and presentation of a Raga, within the governing principles of Raga Lakshan. This part of the musical presentation usually does not have any rhythmic accompaniment. Alapana, Alapti and Alap are all synonymous. Raga Alapana uses certain syllables and vocal solfas as a means to sing. Read [this post](/pages/intro/Alap) for explanation.

The systematic presentation, according to some of our scriptures can be classified into the following parts :

### Akshiptika or the Introduction

Akshiptika is a condensed alapana wherein the whole identity and structure of the Raga is established quickly in a few phrases. Typically, this part of the Alapana would be in the Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). This enables fellow musicians on the stage, and listeners alike to immediately relate to the Raga being presented. The familiarity helps in following and enjoying the presentation of the Raga.

### Raga Vardhani or the main body of the Alapana

Raga Vardhani is the biggest part of Alapana. This in turn consists of 4 stages. Stage 1 of the alapana starts with Madhya Sthayi Shadaj, and explores the Raga in Mandra Sthayi (lower octave) and Madhya Sthayi (middle octave). Here, the identity of the Raga is further established through the usage of appropriate phrases, intonations and note emphasis points. Stage 2 of the alapana consists of exploring the Raga in all its nuances, a note by note exploration, giving full freedom to the creative process. Ocassionally, the phrases may touch Tara Sthayi ( higher octave), but predomoinantly restricted to lower and middle octave. In Stage 3, most of the exploration happens in higher octave, ocassionally coming down to middle octave. Stage 4 is the concluding part where *sancharis* (phrases) across all 3 octaves are presented. This part maybe in a slightly faster tempo compared to the earlier stages.

### Sthayi

Sthayi is a melodic structure where the starting note, and the ending note of the phrase are the same. In this section, a musician can pick starting notes, create a melodic phrase, and return to the starting note. Where the starting notes are in ascending form, its called *Arohana sthayi*, and where the starting notes are in descending form, its called *Avarohana sthayi*.

### Vartani or Madhyamakala (Also popularly known as Tanam or Jod/Jhala)

In this section, there is a perceptible rhythm in the singing or playing. On an instrument like Veena, the *Chikari / Talam* strings provide a sense of rhythm to the melodic phrases. This section is usually in medium tempo - and hence the name madhyamakala (middle tempo). This section in dhrutakala or fast tempo is called *Ghanam / Jhala*.

### Nyasa or the conclusion, also known as Muktayi

This is the concluding part, where *sancharis* or melodic phrases across the octaves are presented, in a continuous movement providing a climax to the whole Raga Alapana.

## Pallavi

The word Pallavi is believed to be a concatenation of 3 words *Pa*dam, *La*yam, *Vi*nyasam. Padam is a lyrical or a musical phrase, Layam is a rhythmic structure or Talam, and Vinayasam is the rhythmic exploration of the set musical phrase within the framework of the Raga Lakshana. This was also known as Rupak Alapti in early texts on Indian music. The musical phrase is set in a way such that there are certain emphasis points in the rhythmic cycle, the starting point and the ending point of the musical phrase in the rhythmic cycle. For eg, in a cycle of 12 beats, the starting point of the Padam maybe on the 9th beat, the emphasis point on the 1st beat, and the end point on the 8th beat. One generally tries to keep this basic structure intact, and explore the musical phrase rhythmically. 

This post is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it gives a glimpse into the process of Raga Alapana and Pallavi. I also hope that this allows you to follow and enjoy the tracks.
