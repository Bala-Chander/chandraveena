Having worked at leadership positions in the corporate world and as a performing Indian Classical musician, I am fortunate to have experienced what many may regard as two different worlds. Yes, Indian Classical music does have its own code of conduct. But the professional world and the world of music have more in common than you may think.

During my education and early professional life, I was trained in Indian Classical music in quite a traditional system, by a great musician and thinker, Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. This system of training wasn’t just about music, but more as a way of life, of being part of society and as a life philosophy which is actually applicable to any field.

I don't think the Apple reference and the Jobs quote is really relevant here.
So I deleted it.

So here are a few lessons from the world of music which I find are quite relevant to the professional world.

### Team Work

Every time a Symphony performs, where anywhere between 50-100 musicians work in perfect sync, its an amazing experience to watch and hear. During pre-digital era, all recordings were done on analog tapes. They had to be imported and were very expensive. Many Indian film songs and other orchestra recordings were completed flawlessly in a single take, as retakes on analog tapes were considered very expensive!

For me personally, every time I go on stage with my accompanying musicians, we work together and make every effort to present a cohesive performance. Most of our music is improvisation based. Even while we are creating the music extempore, it is our understanding and teamwork that makes the music come together as one performance, like any other endeavour.  

There is strength and beauty in team work.

Editor's note:

This is the kind of template which I think works well for explaining each value.
* Talk about general observations which people may be aware of.
* Talk about personal experiences pertinent to the value.
* Conclude with how the value is essential to those experiences or events.
```

### Individual Development

During the early days of my musical training, it was just that - hours of training ! The emphasis was more about developing techniques, and understanding music. Obviously, under the influence of a great master like my Ustad, it was only natural to try and imitate. To be honest, it always seemed beyond reach, and attempts at imitating were often a grand failure.

However, Ustad often encouraged his students to discover their own personality. I was encouraged to develop my music and give it my own identity. We are as individual and different as our fingerprints. We are made of our experiences, temperament, attitudes, backgrounds, surroundings etc. We act and react differently. Rather than be a poor version of someone, I had to try to be the best version of myself. 

We can really perform at our best, when we are in our own skin.

```
Editor's note:

Again, an attempt at presenting this value:
* Cite personal experiences (being told to not imitate, but find own identity)
* Conclude (we do it best, when we do it our way)
```

## Empathy and Compassion

As part of my training as a musician and a person, I was taught "Manavta" or Humanity is the core essense of our being. Building a sense of humanity, to feel for others, was as essential a part of our development as a musician, as musical techniques. 

As humans, we naturally relate to emotional connect. As a musician, I try to please my senses and create an emotional response in the listeners. Years of being a musician makes us sensitive to emotional perception, the ability to understand and feel for another. Both, in my career in the corporate world, and as a musician, empathy and compassion to my colleagues have always in return yielded cooperation, mutual respect, trust and understanding.

Empathy and compassion builds trust and loyalty, which in turn builds a strong team and performance.

## Creative thinking

After technical training in music, initially as a performing artist, it would be only natural to try and imitate Ustad. How does one make ones' own music ? I was always taught to push boundaries, use my own imagination, think beyond what i know. 

Years and years of thinking beyond has developed creativity not only in music, but all around. As musicians, creative thinking comes naturally.

Many situations call for tangential thoughts or out of the box thinking. Connecting the dots comes naturally.
