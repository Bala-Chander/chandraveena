Having worked at leadership positions in the corporate world and as a performing Indian Classical musician, I am fortunate to have experienced what many may regard as two different worlds. Yes, Indian Classical music does have its own code of conduct. But the professional world and the world of music have more in common than you may think.

During my education and early professional life, I was trained in Indian Classical music in quite a traditional system, by a great musician and thinker, Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. This system of training wasn’t just about music, but more as a way of life, of being part of society and as a life philosophy which is actually applicable to any field.

I don't think the Apple reference and the Jobs quote is really relevant here.
So I deleted it.

So here are a few lessons from the world of music which are quite relevant to the professional world.

### Team Work

You may have seen an orchestra of a hundred musicians, performing a symphony with perfect coordination. Or if you are old enough, you may have heard of Indian film songs being recorded flawlessly in a single take, as retakes on analog tapes were considered very expensive!

For me personally, every time I go on stage with my accompanying musicians, we have to get along with each other and make every effort to present a cohesive performance. Indian Classical music is based on improvisation, so we are creating the music extempore. But it is our teamwork that makes the music come together as one performance, like any other endeavour.

```
Editor's note:

This is the kind of template which I think works well for explaining each value.
* Talk about general observations which people may be aware of.
* Talk about personal experiences pertinent to the value.
* Conclude with how the value is essential to those experiences or events.
```

### Individual Development

During the early days of my musical training, the emphasis was more about developing techniques, and understanding music. Obviously, under the influence of a great master like my Ustad, it was only natural to try and imitate. To be honest, it always seemed beyond reach, and attempts at imitating were often a grand failure.

However, Ustad often encouraged his students to discover their own personality. I was encouraged to develop my music and give it my own identity. Rather than be a poor version of someone, I had to try to be the best version of myself. We can really perform at our best, when we are in our own skin.

```
Editor's note:

Again, an attempt at presenting this value:
* Cite personal experiences (being told to not imitate, but find own identity)
* Conclude (we do it best, when we do it our way)
```

## Empathy and Compassion

Empathy and Compassion are often perceived as weak emotions in the Corporate world, and other places. I was taught “Manavta” or Humanity is the core essence of our being. We need more of it today than ever before. Empathy is feeling for the fellow employee / team member, and compassion is the willingness to act on Empathy. Everyone’ life story is different, bit of an effort in understanding the other person goes a long way. Decades of working with music has created a sensitivity to empathy. After all music is that which evokes emotions.

Being empathetic and compassionate builds trust and loyalty, which in turn results in optimal performance.

## Creative thinking

As musicians, creative thinking comes naturally. Many situations call for tangential thoughts or out of the box thinking. Like Steve Jobs says, we’re good at connecting the dots but we also see dots where there are none.

Whether its creating a product line, or solving a Technology problem or resolving a Customer dispute, the ability to think creative, to find a non-standard solution to a problem cannot be underestimated.

## Concentration

Decades of training, and hours of continuous practice builds a tremendous power of concentration and focus on work at hand. Being in the present moment every moment creating music, mindfulness and being aware of thoughts / surroundings is part of the process.

With so much distraction around us, ability to continuously focus on work at hand is an extremely valuable skill in terms of productivity.

## Motor skills

Motor skills ability depends on how well the brain, the nervous system and the muscles work in tandem. An instrumentalist like me, use multiple fingers to play. Imagine now that my mind is creating a bunch of musical thoughts, my right hand fingers has to execute a set of strokes, my left hand fingers has to move on frets accordingly, while feet tapping to rhythm and at the same time, processing accompanying musicians patterns. Decades of doing this has developed strong motor skills.

This is an extremely valuable skill to have for any activity that requires coordination of mind and body, which is pretty much every activity ! Especially at higher levels of corporate management, where time is at premium, having sharp motor skills is invaluable in efficient time management.

## Crisis Managment

Years of practice in repeating musical phrases as exercises builds a certain internal strength and calmness. It’s akin to meditation, it creates a stillness of the mind. This allows one to think clear.

Not being in panic mode is extremely valuable. Ability to focus, calmly analyse the situation with a clear mind, and decide on the way forward to deal with the situation is a great skill to have.
