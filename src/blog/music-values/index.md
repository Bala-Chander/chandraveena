Having worked at the highest echelons of corporate world at CXO positions, and as an performing Indian Classical Musician, I have experiences to share. While pursuing my education, and during my work period as well, I was trained in Indian Classical music in a traditional system for many years by a great musician and thinker Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. This system of training wasn’t just about music, but as a way of life, as a way to live and relate in society, a life philosophy many of which could be applied to any field.

As an artist, I have always looked at products of Apple as works of art, beyond just a technological innovation. It comes to mind what Steve Jobs had to say :

> The best way to be creative is to surround yourself with culture, art and history. Serendipity and connecting the dots may be more important than we think. Creativity is just connecting things.

# Valuable lessons

## Team Work

Imagine an orchestra of 100 musicians, performing a symphony or even say a film song. There is a single orchestra conductor, sometimes 20 violinists, 10 bassists , a lead pianist, vocalist and other instrumental musicians. Every single movement, every single musical bar, piece needs to work in sync and in coordination, one wrong movement by one musician can take down the whole performance.

I have been a witness to a few group / orchestra recordings at the erstwhile HMV studios, when analog tapes were used for mastering, and live musicians played. They didn’t have the luxury we have today in the digital medium of being able to record any number of times, erase, re record etc. Often, it needed to be perfect in a single take. One error by any one team member, and the whole recording from the beginning needed to be done again. Needless to say, there were rehearsals, but at the final take, everyone worked as one team.

The success in a musical performance, whether in a symphony or an orchestra or an Indian classical music concert, the best performance is a cohesive performance by all team members.

Let’s look at a corporate set up. There is a product line, supported by marketing, which is in turn supported by sales and customer service, and then there are back end services like HR, IT etc. Every success of a product, and therefore the organisation depends on the whole human supply chain working together seamlessly as a team.

## Personality Development

During the early days of my musical training, it was all about developing techniques, and understanding of music. Obviously, under the influence of a great master like my Ustad, it is only natural to try and imitate. To be honest it always seemed beyond reach, and a grand failure. However, I was often encouraged to discover my own personality, and give my music my own identity for its likely to be the best version of me. We perform at our best in our own skin.

Encouraging team members and employees to think, to work to their strengths always brings out the best performance from them.

## Empathy and Compassion

Empathy and Compassion are often perceived as weak emotions in the Corporate world, and other places. I was taught “Manavta” or Humanity is the core essence of our being. We need more of it today than ever before. Empathy is feeling for the fellow employee / team member, and compassion is the willingness to act on Empathy. Everyone’ life story is different, bit of an effort in understanding the other person goes a long way. Decades of working with music has created a sensitivity to empathy. After all music is that which evokes emotions.

Being empathetic and compassionate builds trust and loyalty, which in turn results in optimal performance.

## Creative thinking

As musicians, creative thinking comes naturally. Many situations call for tangential thoughts or out of the box thinking. Like Steve Jobs says, we’re good at connecting the dots but we also see dots where there are none.

Whether its creating a product line, or solving a Technology problem or resolving a Customer dispute, the ability to think creative, to find a non-standard solution to a problem cannot be underestimated.

## Concentration

Decades of training, and hours of continuous practice builds a tremendous power of concentration and focus on work at hand. Being in the present moment every moment creating music, mindfulness and being aware of thoughts / surroundings is part of the process.

With so much distraction around us, ability to continuously focus on work at hand is an extremely valuable skill in terms of productivity.

## Motor skills

Motor skills ability depends on how well the brain, the nervous system and the muscles work in tandem. An instrumentalist like me, use multiple fingers to play. Imagine now that my mind is creating a bunch of musical thoughts, my right hand fingers has to execute a set of strokes, my left hand fingers has to move on frets accordingly, while feet tapping to rhythm and at the same time, processing accompanying musicians patterns. Decades of doing this has developed strong motor skills.

This is an extremely valuable skill to have for any activity that requires coordination of mind and body, which is pretty much every activity ! Especially at higher levels of corporate management, where time is at premium, having sharp motor skills is invaluable in efficient time management.

## Crisis Managment

Years of practice in repeating musical phrases as exercises builds a certain internal strength and calmness. It’s akin to meditation, it creates a stillness of the mind. This allows one to think clear.

Not being in panic mode is extremely valuable. Ability to focus, calmly analyse the situation with a clear mind, and decide on the way forward to deal with the situation is a great skill to have.
