description: "Indian Classical music performances have a very sophisticated melodic and rhythmic structure. There are no pre-written score sheets to guide an artist, and yet an artist is able to create beautiful melodic / rhythmic phrases. Often these extempore creations are backed by years of training and understanding. Here is a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes work."

Any Indian Classical Music performance is often characterised by two aspects :   
i. There are no score sheets for a music performance.  
ii. Music performed is extempore improvisation.

Point 1 is mostly true. Sometimes, some artists use reference notes for lyrics of a composition.

Here I am going to talk more about Point 2, extempore improvisation. What is extempore improvisation ? And how extempore is extempore ?

An extempore improvisation in an Indian Classical Music performance is an artists’ ability to create imaginative musical/rhythmic phrases, "within the structure and the framework" of the Raga and the Tala. 

"Within the structure and the framework" is an important concept, also known as Lakshana (Grammar or theory of music) and Lakshya (Presentation). We will address these two aspects in a separate more detailed post. We undergo years of training to understand the framework governing the principles of Raga and Tala. We practice for hours everyday, we try different ideas, musical phrases, variations in rhythmic patterns etc. Some ideas work out, some don’t. In the process, we make mistakes too, and they are as important, for we learn as much from what not to do as in what to do.

Vocalists also need to be aware of “Sahitya”, or the words of a composition. While creating improvisations in musical and rhythmic phrases, its equally important to maintain the mood and the meaning of the composition, and correct pronunciation.

All these aspects require regular and repeated practice. A poorly executed musical idea is not really so musical to hear. So what you hear is often a refined version of what goes on in the practice sessions. Many of the extempore ideas in a performance are ideas that have been tried out in practice sessions. 

As we mature, as we understand our music better, as our technical capabilities improve, we are able to try out more and more ideas. After years of training and practice, the mind starts connecting the dots, so one has the ability to execute an idea practiced in one Raga or Tala in an entirely different Raga or Tala. We are able to freely create “extempore” musical / rhythmic phrases in a performance backed by the knowledge and years of practice.

There are two ways in which this improvisation can happen. *Raga Alapana* - where the melodic structure of the Raga is explored. This part usually does not have any rhythmic accompaniment. *Vistar* or *Niraval*, which is musical and rhythmic improvisation of a *Pallavi* or a composition. This part usually has an rhythmic accompaniment by a Tabla / Pakhawaj / Mridangam etc.

We are releasing a few videos which have captured the behind the scenes practice ! Some were recorded while testing the recording setup, some were recorded while trying out ideas. These videos are being presented to you completely uncensored / uncut. You will get to see what goes on in practice sessions. There may be various ideas being tried out, mistakes made etc. 

Out of all this rough cut comes the finesse in music. Enjoy the sessions.

There are 3 releases as part of the Jam Sessions.
