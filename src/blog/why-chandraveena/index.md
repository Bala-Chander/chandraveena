For those who may have landed on this link, and not aware - Chandraveena is a modern instrument, based on the more traditional Saraswati Veena, but designed and built to play Dhrupad. This instrument was designed by me, and the first prototype was built my personal instrument maker, the Late Mohan Lal Sharma from Kolkata.

I have often been asked “Why did you make Chandraveena ?”, “What is the purpose ?”, “Why not play Rudra Veena ?”  Etc. Relevant questions !

I wasn’t always playing Chandraveena ! After early elementary training in Saraswati Veena in Carnatic music during school days in Madurai, I moved to Mumbai for college education. As a kid, I was always fascinated by the sound of Sarod, though in Madurai i had never seen one. Imagine an pre-internet era where I didn’t have the ability to google sarod ! Nevertheless fascinated by the sound of the instrument, i was keen to learn it.

Being in Mumbai, gave me that opportunity. One of my early mentors in my musical journey, late Chandu Kapadia went about finding a Sarod teacher for me. Though i had this dream of learning from Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Chandu felt that it would be better if i had basic training from another teacher. It took us couple of years, but Chandu one day took me to meet Pandit Pradeep Barot - who eventually became my only Sarod guru ! And herein starts my journey of learning Sarod.
Being a student of St.Xaviers’ College has its immense benefits. In addition to being a great college of education, it also had many activities. One such was a music library, then called IMG Britannia Music Library. As a member of the Library, and later as a committee member of the Library, I not only has access to hundreds of hours of music to listen, but also came in close contact with many great musicians like Pt Bhimsen Joshi, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Pt Ravi Shankar, Ustad Allah Rakha etc etc. These experiences and interactions laid the foundation for my later journey as a student of music, and as a performer.

While i was fumbling about learning the basics of Sarod from Pt Pradeep Barot, in my college, i met Bahahuddin Dagar - son of late Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. This became a life changing event, for it brought me in contact with Ustad Z M Dagar. I instantly related to his music, the grand and sensitive exploration of a raga on an even grander instrument - Rudra Veena as designed by him which later went on to be called Dagar Veena. And here for the first time i heard the name “Sursringar” - a rare ancient instrument. Over many interactions, i fell in love with the music, and the man behind the music - and here i was very sure this is the music i want to pursue ! I had no idea what, how or when , but this much was clear in my deepest of heart - i want to learn this great form of music from this great Ustad !!

Destiny.. can sometimes have unexpected twists and turns.. some are wonderful , but some cruel twist of fate....

Just when there was happiness in heart - in having found the music of the soul, and the man behind the music - due to some twisted corny fate, Ustad Z M Dagar suddenly passed away. While shocked at losing a great Ustad, and wondering on my own life and music, this twist of fate also brought me in touch with his illustrious brother vocalist Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar — a journey lasting 23 beautiful years till his demise in 2013.

However, unsure of my musical life, I continued my formal college education, and later took up corporate jobs while at the same time being closely associated with music, continuing my training in Sarod, and in Dhrupad under Ustad Z F Dagar. At one point, we had this dream of my playing Sarod and Sursringar - a unique combination of two beautiful instruments in different styles. However, it was difficult to find a maker of Sursringar, and one maker was charging what was equivalent to my family’s one year’s annual income !!! I quickly gave up that idea, albeit temporarily, and continued my job, and training in Dhrupad, all along with the dream of playing Sarod and Sursringar !

One day, while chatting with Ustad and Bahauddin, they were jointly of the opinion that i should abandon this sarod / sursringar, and go back to playing Saraswati Veena all over again , and this time in Dhrupad style !!! And herein starts my journey on “Why Chandraveena” !!!

This journey starts with me going to Chennai to get a standard Saraswati Veena, retraining on Saraswati Veena, understanding the limitations of the instrument for the Dhrupad style of my Ustad, redesigning the instrument for the needs of the music, going in search of Veena makers in Mysore, Thanjavur, Trichy, Kolkata .. and landed at the doorstep of someone who became my personal instrument maker - late Mohan Lal Sharma of Kolkata. The limitations of Saraswati Veena to effectively portray my Ustad’s style of music led to the creating of Chandraveena.

“Necessity is the mother of Invention”

Even though my initial approach to Mohan Lal Sharma was for Sursringar, he eventually agreed to be part of my experiments, and created the first prototype of what eventually was christened “Chandraveena” by Ustad Z F Dagar and Ustad Bahauddin Dagar.
