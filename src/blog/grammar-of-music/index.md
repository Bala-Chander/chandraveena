description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I talk about grammar of Indian Classical Music. Read on to find out more!"

Indian Classical Music was not always like we know, having evolved continuously over a period of 1500 - 2000 years. Despite the long evolution, it has retained its fundamental identity and principles. In an [earlier post](/blog/what-is-classical/), we talked about how the intertwined evolution of *Lakshya* (presentation) and *Lakshana* (grammar) have lent Indian Classical Music its distinctive identity. Now let us take a closer look at Lakshanas.

Like with any language, even for music, a grammatical framework is essential for effective communication and consistent understanding. In Indian Classical music, treatises on musical grammar and rules are called *Lakshanagranthas* (books of grammar), which have evolved and developed over many centuries. Lakshanagranthas deal primarily with Lakshanas, although they do talk about Lakshya as well.

If one were to divide the evolution of Indian classical music into different eras, I would say that the introduction of the concept of *Adhara Shadaj* (fixed fundamental tonic) is a major dividing phase. As part of this major change, Indian music evolved and certain aspects of Lakshya and Lakshana were modified. Some new forms came into place while other forms became obsolete. But many concepts and terminologies were carried over with a different interpretation.

*A Timeline of Indian Classical Music*

First, let us explain the concepts of *Gram*, *Jaati* and *Murchhana*. Briefly, a *Gram* is a subdivision of an octave into a set of musical notes (7 or 12?). A *Jaati* is a reference musical scale formed by taking seven (or fewer?) notes from a *Gram*. Finally, a *Murchhana* is a musical scale derived from a Jaati by a cyclical permutation of its notes. In other words, a Murchhana is formed from a Jaati by beginning at some starting note and going up the notes till the octave is completed with respect to the starting note.

In contrast, an *Adhara Shadaj* means that the starting note is fixed. Musical scales are then derived by taking sets of 5, 6 or 7 notes from an octave. The octave can be considered to be divided into 12 notes, but these 12 positions merely represent a reference value for each of the 12 notes. The actual shade of each note depends on the Raga or musical scale.

As you can see, there is a significant difference between the way musical scales were constructed in the pre-Adhara Shadaj era and how they are understood today in the post-Adhara Shadaj era.

Let us take a few examples of Lakshanas, and see what they mean and how they evolved across these period. For ease of understanding, let us group the Lakshanas into those pertaining to: (a) the importance of *Swaras* or individual notes; (b) the timing and usage of Swaras; and (c) musical phrases and scales. Note that this commentary is generic and would not define any specific Lakshanas for any specific Raga.

## Types of Swaras

* **Graha**: In the pre-Adhara Shadaj days, the *Graha* (home) swar was a very important concept and reference for a musical performance. This was because the music was based on *Jatis* (modes) derived from *Murchhana* (scale), and it was the Graha swar which was the starting note defining the mode. However, in the post-Adhara Shadaj era, all Ragas are being sung to a single reference note *Sa*. In effect, the *Sa* is the Graha swar for all Ragas. 

* **Amsa**: The most often used note is called *Amsa*. Amsa literally a man's shoulder or a bull's hump. Musically, it means the note that shoulders the weight of the Raga.

* **Vadi, Samvadi**: In today's understanding of music, *Vadi* denotes the most important note of the Raga, and *Samvadi* as the second most important note of the Raga. However, *Vadi* means a speaking note, or any note of the Raga. *Samvadi* is a consonant note of the Vadi note - which is generally its 4th (Madhyama bhav) or its 5th (Pancham bhav). 

* **Anuvadi, Vivadi**: *Anuvadi* is a note descibed as being in harmony, typically the 3rd (tivra gandhara or komal gandhar) of a note. *Vivadi* literally means a contest or arguement. Musically it means a note so close to the original that one can argue / contest the note. For eg, if I have a very sharp Rishab, and a very flattened komal Gandhar, one could say the two notes are Vivadi to each other. To use it musically is lakshya - the artists' ability to bring the beauty.

* **Nyasa**: *Nyasa* is a halting note of a musical phrase. It could be samvadi / anuvadi of the starting note of the musical phrase, or the amsa note of the Raga.

The dropping of notes were defined by scale characteristics - *Shadav* (hexatonic), *Audav* (pentatonic), the absence of either meant a 7 note scale. 

## Timing and Usage of Swaras

* **Alpatva**: *Alpatva* note is one which is rarely and fleetingly used note. 

* **Bahutva**: *Bahutava* note is one which is often used. Graha, Amsa notes are generally Bahutva notes.

* **Hrasva**: *Hrasva* note is one on which musical phrase doesn't linger for long periods of time.

* **Deergha**: *Deergha* note is one where a musical phrase can halt for considerable time.

Hrasva and Deergha are also applicable in compositions where they mean short vowels and long vowels.

## Musical Phrases and Scales

* **Aarohi**: *Aarohi* - Ascending set of notes, for eg. Sa Re Ga ma Pa

* **Avarohi**: *Avarohi* - Descending set of notes, for eg. Dha Pa ma Ga Re

* **Sthayi**: *Sthayi* literally means constant, musically, it means a fixed note around which musical phrases revolve. Sthayi is used in the context of a musical phrase, octave, in Raga Alapana and in Composition (Pallavi). A few examples of sthayi (taking **Sa** as the Sthayi note) : **Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni Sa'**, **Sa Re Sa**, **Sa Re Sa'**, etc. Here **Sa'** represents the octave of the fundamental **Sa**.

* **Melakarta and Janaka Raga**: A parent Raga from which other Ragas are derived. Melakarta Ragas are always heptatonic. Janka Raga could be heptatonic or less.

* **Janya Raga**: A derived Raga from a Melakarta or a Janaka Raga. The scale could be sampoorna (heptatonic), shadava (hexatonic), oudava (pentatonic). Also note that Janya Ragas can be assymmetric for eg. it could be audava ascending and shadava descending scale. Other combinations of arohi / avarohi scales are also possible.

## Defining a Raga
<mark>
A *Raga* is a musical scale, together with a set of Lakshanas and Lakshya which results in a consistent, recognisable musical framework. Within the reference of a Raga, an artist can attempt to improvise and develop the Raga through a musical performance.

Now for a given Raga, each of these Lakshanas mentioned above are clearly defined. Through a cycle of listening, learning, practicing and performing, a student can learn the Lakshya aspect of a given Raga as well. However, these only define the framework and by themselves do not make music. Within this framework, a Raga presentation which can be described as *Ranjayati* (that which illuminates, gratifies and colours the mind) is the most important characteristic in the presentation of a Raga.

In subsequent posts, I would explore how these can be incorporated into a musical performance in the form of a *Raga Alapana* or *Pallavi*.
