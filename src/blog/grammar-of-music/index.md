description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I share my reading of what a Raga Alapana and Pallavi is. Read on to find out more!"

Our music was not always like we know and understand today. As music evolved, many great musicians and musicologists have played a role in contributing to the Indian Classical Music as we know it today. Lakshana and Lakshaya go hand in hand. In some instances lakshana was formed after lakshya to give a framework, and in other instances, lakshya follows lakshana. To have a full command over Indian Classical Music, I feel it is imperative to have a proper understanding of both lakshya and lakshana for a lack of one will lead to misinterpretation of the other.

As a natural part of evolution, certain aspects of lakshya and lakshana were modified, some new forms came in place, some forms became obsolete, certain terminologies were carried over with a different context etc. In my opinion, the introduction of the concept of *Adhara Shadaj* (reference tonic note) was a turning point in our music. According to my understanding, this is likely to have happened between 13th century - 16 century. It is not yet clear to me what led to the change, or what were the influences, but music changed so much so that I would actually classify Indian Classical Music as pre-Adhara Shadaj era and post-Adhara Shadaj era. Pre-Adhara Shadaj era music was based on Murchchana (Scales) and Jatis (modes), a system in which every scale change gave rise to a new Jati or melody. Post-Adhara Shadaj era, as we know it today, is based on performing a musical scale to a single reference tonic note. As such, the concept of scale change became irrelevant. Ragas, as the Jatis now are known, are classified in a variety of ways - Raga / Ragini system, Melakartha system, Janaka / Janya system, Thaat system etc. The system to follow to some extent depends on the school/style of music wherein the artist has been trained, and partly also the artists' choice. The system of Raga and Raga classification is outside the purview of this article, and is a vast subject in itself.

Lets take few examples of lashanas (grammar), and see what they mean.

*Graha* (Home) swar was a very important concept in the pre-Adhara Shadaj days. Why ? Because the music was based on *Jatis* (modes) derived from Murchhana (scale). Every mode had a starting note, infact, starting note defined the mode, and hence the importance as a home note. However, in the post-Adhara Shadaj era, all Ragas are being sung to a single reference note Sa, ineffect Sa being the Graha note for all Ragas making it irrelevant. The most often used note is called *Amsa*. Amsa literally mans shoulder or a bull's hump, musically, it means the note that shoulders the weight of the Raga.

As Raga music evolved, in today's music *Vadi* denotes the most important note of the Raga, and *Samvadi* as the second most important note of the Raga. I am of a different opinion based on my reading of both pre-Adhara Shadaj scriptures and post-Adhara Shadaj scriptures. *Vadi* means a speaking note, for every note of a Raga is a Vadi note. Samvadi is a consonant note of the Vadi note - which will be 4th (madhyama bhav) or the 5th (pancham bhav). 

*Anuvadi* is a note descibed as being in harmony, typically the 3rd (tivra gandhara bhav) of a note. *Vivadi* is incorrectly understood as banned note. Far from it, vivadi notes are used. Vivadi literally means a contest or arguement. Musically it means a note so close to the original that one can contest the note. For eg, if I have a very sharp Rishab, and a very flattened komal Gandhar, one could say the two notes are Vivadi to each other. To use it musically is lakshya - the artists' ability to bring the beauty.

*Nyasa* is a halting note of a musical phrase. It could be samvadi / anuvadi of the starting note of the musical phrase, or the amsa note of the Raga. 

The dropping of notes were defined by scale characteristics - *Shadav* (hexatonic), *Audav* (pentatonic), the absence of either meant a 7 note scale. 

*Alpatva* note is one which is rarely and fleetingly used note. 

*Bahutava* note is one which is often used. Graha, Amsa notes are generally Bahutva notes.

*Hrasva* note is one on which musical phrase doesnt linger for long periods of time.

*Deergha* note is one where a musical phrase can halt for considerable time.

Hrasva and Deergha are also applicable in compositions where they mean short vowels and long vowels.

*Sthayi* today denotes an octave. However, *Sthayi* literally means constant, musically, it means a fixed note around which musical phrases revolve. Now, if you take Sa as the Sthayi note, you can see how it can easily denote an octave, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa' (octave Sa, or Tara Sa or as is correctly called *Dviguna* swar). There are many ways in which sthayi can be formed. For eg : Sa Re Sa, Sa Re Sa', Sa Ma Pa Sa, Sa' Pa Ma Sa etc (Sa - middle octave, Sa' - higher octave)... Infact, I have here taken Sa as an example, it can be any note as long as the rule is followed. Sthayi is used in the context of a musical phrase, in Raga Alapana and in Composition (Pallavi).
