description: "I am S. Balachander, an Indian classical musician and a performing artist of Chandraveena. In my long association with music, I have been privileged to have had deep and meaningful discussions on the theory of music with my Ustad, and undertaken further study of scriptures to understand our music better. Here I talk about grammar of Indian Classical Music. Read on to find out more!"

For effective communication and consistent understanding of a language, a grammar framework is essential. These grammar framework treatises in Indian Classical music are called *lakshanagranthas*, which have evolved and developed over many centuries. Lakshanagranthas deal with two aspects of Indian classical music as a performing art - *lakshanas* (grammar or theory of music) and *lakshya* (presentation).

Our music was not always like we know and understand today. If one were to divide Indian classical music into different eras, I would say that the introduction of the concept of *Adhara Shadaj* (fixed fundamental tonic) would be the dividing line. As a natural part of evolution, as music evolved, certain aspects of lakshya and lakshana were modified, some new forms came in place, some forms became obsolete, certain terminologies were carried over with a different context. 

Lets take few examples of lakshanas, and see what they mean.

*Graha* (Home) swar was a very important concept in the pre-Adhara Shadaj days. Why ? Because the music was based on *Jatis* (modes) derived from Murchhana (scale). Every mode had a starting note, infact, starting note defined the mode, and hence the importance as a home note. However, in the post-Adhara Shadaj era, all Ragas are being sung to a single reference note Sa, ineffect Sa being the Graha note for all Ragas. 

The most often used note is called *Amsa*. Amsa literally mans shoulder or a bull's hump, musically, it means the note that shoulders the weight of the Raga.

In today's understanding of music, *Vadi* denotes the most important note of the Raga, and *Samvadi* as the second most important note of the Raga. However, *Vadi* means a speaking note, or any note of the Raga. *Samvadi* is a consonant note of the Vadi note - which will be 4th (madhyama bhav) or the 5th (pancham bhav). 

*Anuvadi* is a note descibed as being in harmony, typically the 3rd (tivra gandhara or komal gandhar) of a note. 

*Vivadi* literally means a contest or arguement. Musically it means a note so close to the original that one can argue / contest the note. For eg, if I have a very sharp Rishab, and a very flattened komal Gandhar, one could say the two notes are Vivadi to each other. To use it musically is lakshya - the artists' ability to bring the beauty.

*Nyasa* is a halting note of a musical phrase. It could be samvadi / anuvadi of the starting note of the musical phrase, or the amsa note of the Raga. 

The dropping of notes were defined by scale characteristics - *Shadav* (hexatonic), *Audav* (pentatonic), the absence of either meant a 7 note scale. 

*Alpatva* note is one which is rarely and fleetingly used note. 

*Bahutava* note is one which is often used. Graha, Amsa notes are generally Bahutva notes.

*Hrasva* note is one on which musical phrase doesn't linger for long periods of time.

*Deergha* note is one where a musical phrase can halt for considerable time.

Hrasva and Deergha are also applicable in compositions where they mean short vowels and long vowels.

*Arohi* - Ascending set of notes, for eg. Sa Re Ga ma Pa

*Avarohi* - Descending set of notes, for eg. Dha Pa ma Ga Re

*Sthayi* literally means constant, musically, it means a fixed note around which musical phrases revolve. Sthayi is used in the context of a musical phrase, octave, in Raga Alapana and in Composition (Pallavi). 
Few examples of sthayi (taking Sa as the Sthayi note) : Sa Re Ga ma Pa Dha Ni Sa', Sa Re Sa, Sa Re Sa' etc.
Sa - middle octave Sa
Sa' - higher octave Sa

*Melakarta* / *Janaka* Raga - A parent Raga from which other Ragas are derived. Melakarta Ragas are always heptatonic. Janka Raga could be heptatonic or less.

*Janya* Raga - A derived Raga from a Melakarta or a Janaka Raga. The scale could be sampoorna (heptatonic), shadava (hexatonic), oudava (pentatonic). Also note that Janya Ragas can be assymmetric for eg. it could be audava ascending and shadava descending scale. Other combinations of arohi / avarohi scales are also possible.

This is about grammar, creating a framework, and understanding the structure. That alone doesnt make music either. Within the framework of this grammar, a Raga presentation which can be described as Ranjayati (that which illuminates, gratifies, colors the mind) is the most important characteristic in the presentation of a Raga - whether its Raga Alapana or Pallavi.
