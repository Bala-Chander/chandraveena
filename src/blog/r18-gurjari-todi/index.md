Over the centuries, the Indian Raga system have evolved from different sources. Some have evolved out of modal / scale change *Murchhanas* of a more basic scale, known as the [Jati-Murchhana system](/blog/grammar-of-music/). Some Ragas were inspired by folk tunes (Eg, Raga Kafi), some evolved out of Regional melodies (Eg, Gowla, Saurashtra etc). These were then formalised according to the [Lakshanas and Lakshyas](/blog/grammar-of-music/) of Indian classical music system. One such regional melody is *Raga Gurjari*, mostly thought to have originated from the [Gurjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurjar) community. 

Though today Raga Gurjari and Raga Gurjari Todi are used interchangeably, they are different Ragas. Let us look at what our treatises say about Raga Gurjari, and how it is related to Raga Gurjari Todi.

According to 17th century literature *Sangita Saramrta* and *Raga Lakshanamu*, Raga Gurjari is a janya(derivative scale) of Mela (parent scale) *Malavagowla*. According to one *Raga-Ragini* (male / female) system of Raga classification, Raga Gurjari is a Ragini of *Raga Bhairav*. Malavagowla and Bhairav scale is:

**Scale** - Sa re Ga ma Pa dha Ni (Please refer to the Program Notes below for the notation.)

Now, the scale of *Raga Gurjari Todi* is:

**Scale** - Sa re ga Ma dha Ni

ga and Ma of Raga Gurjari Todi do not belong to the parent scale of Raga Gurjari. So, where do they come from? Now, let us look at the scale of *Raga Shuddha Todi*.

**Scale** - Sa re ga Ma Pa dha Ni

The ga and Ma on Raga Gurjari Todi is from the Shuddha Todi scale. Hence Raga Gurjari Todi is a mixture of Raga Gurjari and Shuddha Todi scale. This is what we call a *Jod* Raga, a mixture of two scales. This is also a *Pancham Varjit* (fifth dropped) shadav (hexatonic) scale.

I present a Raga Alapana in Raga Gurjari Todi on Chandraveena.

Note the unusual Tanpura tuning for this recording. It will push you out of comfort zone, and yet, will merge with the Raga that is being played.

Enjoy the music.

## Program Notes

### Raga Alapana in Raga Gurjari Todi

Raga [Alapana](/blog/raga-alapana/) is an improvisation and a systematic presentation of a Raga. This part has no rhythmic accompaniment. Usually, it has three parts - Alap, Jod and Jhala. This format is also known as Ragam and Tanam.

Here are some notes about the Raga.

**Raga** - Gurjari Todi

**Scale** - Sa re ga Ma dha Ni

**Family** - Todi

**Melakarta** - Shubhapantuvarali (Sa re ga Ma Pa dha Ni)

**Prahar** - 1st prahar (equivalent to 6 AM  - 9 AM)

### Reading the scale
In Indian Classical Music, the seven notes in an octave are called Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni and then Sa comes again. Notes with a capitalised first letter are called Tivra (or sharp) notes, for eg., Ma, Ni. Notes written fully in lower case are called Komal (or flat) notes. E.g., re, ga above. Sa and Pa are always written with a capitalized first letter.

### Prahar
In Indian Classical Music, Ragas are classified into Prahars (time periods of a day or night) which are said to represent the most appropriate time to perform the Raga.
