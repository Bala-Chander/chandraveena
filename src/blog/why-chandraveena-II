description: "For those who may have landed on this link, and not aware - Chandraveena is a modern instrument, based on the more traditional Saraswati Veena, but designed and built to play Dhrupad. This instrument was designed by me, and the first prototype was built my personal instrument maker, the Late Mohan Lal Sharma from Kolkata."

When the idea of playing Dhrupad on Saraswati Veena was mooted by Ustad Z F Dagar and Ustad Bahauddin, I took the idea with excitement and some trepidation. Even though I had some early basic training in Saraswati Veena - which is what gave the idea to the Ustads - it was more than 15 years since I last played the instrument. In the interim 15 years, all my training was on Sarod and concepts of Dhrupad. 

However, I decided to take up the challenge. I started in earnest by going to Chennai to get a standard Saraswati Veena. It was like trying to bike after 15 years ! Even though I had knowledge of some of the Veena playing techniques, it took me a while to get the balance, to be able to understand the instrumnent. It was back to basics, learning to pedal, learning to look straight and maintain balance without falling off ! However, muscle memory is quite powerful. Couple of years down the line, slowly but steadily, I was learning the ropes of Veena playing, and gradually progressing. 

After a few years, I started attempting to play Dhrupad on Saraswati Veena on a as-is basis of the instrument. Later, I made a few changes, like I changed the main bridge from brass top to horn, added an extra resonator on the top. Some of these changes were experimental to understand the potential of the instrument, and its limitations for the style I wished to pursue on it. 

As I started deeper study and understanding of Dhrupad, and the response of Saraswati Veena better, I also started understanding better the shortcomings of the instrument for the style, and the changes I would need to bring in to adapt the instrument to this particular style of music. 

Based on my understanding of Physics and Acoustics of instruments, and my experiments and experience with Saraswati Veena, I started desgining a new Veena. Structurally based on Saraswati Veena, the new Veena was designed to the demands of the style -- which was characterised by slow moving long phrases, and subtle variations of notes - both of which demanded high resonance and sustain.

Some of the changes made compared to Saraswati Veena, to attain the needs were :

1. the wooden resonator bowl of the Saraswati Veena was replaced by a gourd (pumpkin) resonator which offers better resonance than wood
2. the size of the resonator was increased to provide additional volume of air
3. the soundboard size accordingly increased, offering greater vibration, especially at lower frequence register of the instrument
4. the vibrating length was increased, which offers more scope for subtle variations on notes
5. the thickness of the strings were increased, which gave depth to the sound of the instrument
6. the fret length was increased, which offered greater scope for creating longer phrases on a single fret
  
With this design, I started going in search of Veena makers in Mysore, Thanjavur, Trichy, Kolkata, and so on. Eventually I landed at the doorstep of someone who became my guide and personal instrument maker - the late Mohan Lal Sharma of Kolkata. Even though my initial approach to Mohan Lal Sharma was for Sursringar, he eventually agreed to be part of my experiments.

> Necessity is the mother of Invention

In the end, it was the limitations of Saraswati Veena to effectively portray my Ustad’s style of music that led to the creation of Chandraveena. Mohan Lal Sharma created the first prototype of what eventually was christened “Chandraveena” by Ustad Z F Dagar and Ustad Bahauddin Dagar. Even though Chandraveena has the capability to communicate my music effectively, the experiments and process to continually improve acoustics of the instrument is still a very much an on-going project. As they say, proof of the pudding is in the eating, and I hope you enjoy the sound of the instrument, and the music...
