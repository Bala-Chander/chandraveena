Hello! Welcome to my blog. My close association with music over a period of few decades - as a student, as a connoisseur, and as a performer - has been a journey replete with experiences and stories. Through this blog, I hope to share some of my experiences and thoughts regarding Indian music, World music and several other topics directly or indirectly related to music.

Like the rest of this site, my blog articles will also be in a conversational tone. All opinions expressed are my own - gleaned over the years. You are most welcome to send your remarks and feedback. I may also feature guest articles from time to time from close people who are willing to share their thoughts and experiences. If you have something to contribute, please leave me a note.
