## Early Days and Music Training

I was born into a family of academicians and music lovers. Even though my parents were not trained musicians, there was always music playing at home. This marked my formative years. I received early training in Carnatic Music, the Indian Music of the South. Growing up, my initial training along with exposure to traditional folk music, temple chants and North Indian Music, helped me develop a broader perspective on Indian culture.

My formal training in Music was in Sarod, under Pandit Pradeep Barot. Along the way, I met the legendary Rudra Veena maestro, Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. His artistry and approach to music, inspired me to go deeper into music. After his early demise in 1990, I undertook rigorous training in music, under the renowned Dhrupad vocalist, Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar who continued to mentor and teach me, till his demise in 2013.

## Designing and Playing the Chandraveena

Under the advise of Ustadji (Zia Fariduddin), in 2002, I undertook a research project to use acoustic principles, to modify and redesign the Saraswati Veena, to suit the style of Dhrupad. This research project was awarded a Junior Research Fellowship by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, for the period 2004–2006. Officially titled “North Meets South: Dhrupad on Saraswati Veena”, I completed the project in 2007, and the new Veena was named “Chandraveena” by Ustadji.

Since 2007, I have been extensively touring and performing on Chandraveena, and at the same time, working on further improving the sound and responsiveness of the instrument. The instrument influences my playing style resulting in a natural blend of Carnatic and Dhrupad (Dagar) styles. The music is highly introspective and meditative in nature, keeping in consonance with the philosophy of Maarga Sangeet.

## Music and Professional Activities

My interest in academics, history and musicology has led me to give many lecture demonstrations and talks on Indian Music, and on the Acoustics of Indian Musical Instruments. I also undertook an effort towards the preservation of the Sursringar, an instrument I was initially supposed to play, a rare and beautiful bass instrument which was often played alongside Rudra Veena, in the past. To continue the musical legacy forward, I also teach vocal and instrumental music in the traditional style.

Alongside music, I completed an M.Sc in Physics from St. Xaviers’ College, Mumbai and a Diploma in Computer Science from NCST, Mumbai. Having held various senior management positions in my corporate career, I took a sabbatical from 2002 - 2016 in pursuit of music. Currently, I hold the position of Chief Technologist, Comniscient Group, alongside continuing to pursue music as a performing artist.

## Music Gurus
I am deeply indebted to my musical gurus who have been mentors and guiding spirits both in life and in music.

### Pandit Pradeep Barot
Pandit Pradeep Barot, a renowned sarod player and a humble human being, was my first Guru. He taught me all the techniques of Sarod playing and music. In the early days of my musical journey, when I was not in a position to own a Sarod, he very kindly lent his own Sarod for my practice. For this generous gesture, I will always be grateful to him.

### Late Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar
Meeting Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar was a paradigm shift in my musical journey. His deep understanding of music, his kindness and ability to explain and express the most subtle of musical expressions touched me to the core. Over time, he became my Idol - the man and his music that I wished to emulate. Over a few years of our sporadic meetings, we often had discussions on Indian music of all forms, including Hindustani and Carnatic. These discussions, and his thoughts and approach to music have stayed with me and have been my guiding principle in my approach to music. His unfortunate passing away at an early age, and in the early years of my journey created a vacuum, and also changed my musical journey with many twists and turns. Today, as a performing Veena musician, I look back with veneration and gratitude for his role in shaping my music.

### Late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar
The vacuum created by the early passing away of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar was filled by the presence of his brother, the legendary vocalist Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar. Gradually, I picked up the pieces from where I had left off, and under his constant guidance and training, my musical understanding started maturing. Early on, the thought was that I should play Sarod and Sursringar. But later, Ustadji felt I should try playing the Saraswati Veena (due to my early training in Carnatic music on Saraswati Veena).
After early attempts of trying to produce this style of music on Sarawati Veena, I realised its shortcomings. Based on the need, I redesigned the instrument to suit the Dhrupad style, which was later named Chandraveena by Ustadji.

His booming voice, the richness of his singing, his deep understanding and approach to music and life, our all night conversations on music and history and his fondness for delicacy cooking have all left an indelible mark on me. He became a life changing mentor and a father figure in my life till the end. And even after his demise, I carry his thoughts and principles in my heart. I am truly indebted and grateful to him, for the knowledge he bestowed on me. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zia_Fariduddin_Dagar) about Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar.
