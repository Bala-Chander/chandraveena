Balachander, one of a kind Veena exponent, was born into a family of academicians and music lovers. The early training in Indian Classical Music of the South, along with exposure to traditional folk music, temple chants and North Indian Classical Music gave a broad perspective on Indian culture. He started his formal training in Music in Sarod under Pandit Pradeep Barot – a brilliant sarod player and student of the legendary Annapoorna Devi – in 1986. Inspired by the music and interaction with the legendary Rudra Veena player the late Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar, Balachander undertook rigorous training in Dhrupad under the renowned Dhrupad vocalist the late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar.

Keenly interested in the acoustics of musical instruments, in 2002, Balachander undertook a research project based on acoustic principles to modify and redesign Saraswati Veena to suit the his Guru’s style. This research project was awarded a Junior Research Fellowship by the Ministry of Culture, Govt of India for the period 2004 – 06 titled “North Meets South : Dhrupad on Saraswati Veena”. This project was completed in 2007, and the new Veena was named “Chandra Veena” by his Guru , the Late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar.

Since 2007, Balachander has been extensively touring and performing on Chandra Veena. His playing style is a seamless blend of Carnatic and Dhrupad styles. His music is highly introspective and meditative in nature. A versatile musician with a keen interest in academics, musicology and world music, Balachander has also given many lecture demonstrations and talks on Indian Music, and on Acoustics of Indian Musical Instruments.

In addition to Chandra Veena, Balachander also undertook an effort towards preservation of Sursringar, a rare and beautiful instrument which was often played alongside Rudra Veena.

To continue the legacy forward, along with performance and lectures, Balachander also teaches vocal and instrumental music in the traditional style.

Alongside music, Balachander has an M.Sc in Physics from St. Xaviers’ College, Mumbai and a Diploma in Computer Science, NCST, Mumbai. He has held various senior management positions in his corporate career, and currently holding the position of Chief Technologist, Comniscient Group.

## Music Gurus

### Pandit Pradeep Barot
Pandit Pradeep Barot comes from a musical family of many generations. His grandfather Pt. Rodji Barot was a renowned sarangi player who had the honour of being the court musician of Ratlam state. Pt. Pradeep Barot’s father – Shri Mohanlal Barot was a versatile musician who played the flute, clarinet, saxophone and the harmonium, while his uncle Ratanlal was an accomplished tabla player. Pt Pradeep Barot had his early training in music under the guidance of his father.

Later on, he learnt Sarod from Shri Vasant Rai – a disciple of Baba Allauddin Khan. Eventually, Pt Pradeep Barot became a disciple of Smt. Annapoornadevi – the highly gifted daughter of Baba and herself a great musician. Pt Pradeep Barot plays true to his Gharana – Maihar Gharana – and has a systematic approach to raag vistaar. He is a top grade artist, a performing musician and teacher of Sarod.
In addition to being a performing musician, Pandit Pradeep Barot was also a Staff Musician in the Music Department of Films Division, Mumbai.

### Late Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar
Today Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar’s name has become synonymous with Rudra Veena. This legendary Dhrupadiya and Beenkar was born into the illustrious Dagar family. He had his training in music – both vocal and instrumental (sitar and veena) – from his father “Dhamarnath” Ustad Ziauddin Dagar who was the court musician of Udaipur. After the early demise of his father, Ustadji continued his pursuit based on his early training. He also started his research on Veena and made many changes to bring the necessary depth, resonance and tonal clarity. Ustadji was responsible for the development of the “Rudra Veena” in its present form. He also revived the instrument to concert platform – the first from the Dagar family to take to Veena playing in public.

He was a very versatile musician being equally adept in other instruments like Sitar, Surbahar and Sursringar. He was also a very good vocalist. He was a master of srutis, and had a very good command over raag alaap.

### Late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar
One of the greatest Dhrupad vocalists ever – Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar – belongs to the 19th generation of the Dagar family. He had his initial training in music – vocal, sitar and veena – from his father “Dhamarnath” Ustad Ziauddin Dagar. After the early demise of his father, he continued his training under his elder brother – Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar.

Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar did a lot of research, experiments and work on voice control, timbre, tone etc. He had an amazing control over srutis, and brought Dhrupad vocal to a never heard before level of singing. He also did a lot of research on tanpura and was a master of the technique of “Anahata Naad”.
In addition to being a great vocalist, he also had a deep knowledge of Sangeet Shastras and many other instruments like Sitar, Surbahar, Sursringar and Veena.
