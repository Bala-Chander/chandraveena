Hello, I am Balachander, a Chandra Veena artist performing Indian Classical Music. Before I reached this stage, much has happened, and this is the story of my Musical Journey.

I was born into a family of academicians and music lovers. Even though my parents werent trained musicians, there was music at home and around continuously - and this made my formative years. The early training in Indian Classical Music of the South, along with exposure to traditional folk music, temple chants and North Indian Classical Music gave a broad perspective on Indian culture. My formal training in Music was in Sarod under Pandit Pradeep Barot. Along the way, I met the legendary Rudra Veena maestro, Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar - whose music and approach to music inspired me to go deep into music. After his early demise in 1990, I undertook rigorous training in music under the renowned Dhrupad vocalist the late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar - who continued to mentor and teach me till his demise in 2013.

Under the advise of Ustadji, in 2002, I undertook a research project based on acoustic principles to modify and redesign Saraswati Veena to suit the style. This research project was awarded a Junior Research Fellowship by the Ministry of Culture, Govt of India for the period 2004 – 06 titled “North Meets South : Dhrupad on Saraswati Veena”. This project was completed in 2007, and the new Veena was named “Chandra Veena” by my Ustadji.

Since 2007, I have been extensively touring and performing on Chandra Veena - all the while working on further improving the sound and responsiveness of the instrument. The playing style is naturally a seamless blend of Carnatic and Dagar styles. The music is highly introspective and meditative in nature keeping in consonance with Maarga Sangeet. 

My interest in academics, history and musicology has led me to give many lecture demonstrations and talks on Indian Music, and on Acoustics of Indian Musical Instruments.

I also undertook an effort towards preservation of Sursringar - the instrument I was initially supposed to play, a rare and beautiful bass instrument which was often played alongside Rudra Veena.

To continue the legacy forward, along with performance and lectures, I also teach vocal and instrumental music in the traditional style.

Alongside music, I did an M.Sc in Physics from St. Xaviers’ College, Mumbai and a Diploma in Computer Science, NCST, Mumbai. Having held various senior management positions in my corporate career, I took a sabbatical from 2002 - 2016 in pursuit of music. Currently I hold the position of Chief Technologist, Comniscient Group along with continuing to pursue music as a performing artist.

## Music Gurus
S. Balachander is deeply indebted to his musical gurus - who have been mentors and guiding spirits both in life and in music.

### Pandit Pradeep Barot
Pandit Pradeep Barot, a renowned sarod player and a humble human was my first Guru. He taught me all the techniques of Sarod playing and music. In the early days of my musical journey, when I was not in a position to own a Sarod, he very kindly lent his own Sarod for my practice.
For this, I am very grateful to him, and his gesture.

### Late Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar
My meeting of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar was a paradigm shift in my musical journey. His deep understanding of music, his kindness and ability to explain and express the most subtle of musical expressions touched me to the core. He eventually became my Idol, the man and his music - that I wished to emulate. Over a few years of our sporadic meetings, we often had discussions on music of both forms (Hindustani and Carnatic as is known today). These discussions, and his thoughts and approach to music has stayed with me - and has been my guiding principle in my approach to music.
His unfortunate passing away at an early age, and in the early years of my journey created a vacuum, and also changed my musical journey with many twists and turns.
Today, as a performing Veena musician, I look back with veneration and gratitude for his role in shaping my music.

### Late Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar
The vacuum created by the early passing away of Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar was filled by the presence of his legendary vocalist brother Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. Gradually, I picked up pieces from where I had left off, and under his constant guidance and training, my musical understanding started maturing. Even though the early thought was that I should play Sarod and Sursringar - as a rare combination, later on, Ustadji felt I should try with Saraswati Veena (due to my early training in Carnatic music on Saraswati Veena).
After early attempts of trying to produce this style of music on Sarawati Veena, I realised its shortcomings. Based on the need, I redesigned the instrument to suit the style - which was later named ChandraVeena by Ustadji. 
His booming voice, the richness of his singing, his deep undertanding and approach to music and life, our all night conversations on music and history, his fondness for delicacy cooking have left an indelible mark on me. He became a life changing mentor and a father figure in my life till the end - and even after his demise, I carry his thoughts and principles in my heart. I am truly indebted and grateful to him for the knowledge bestowed on me.
