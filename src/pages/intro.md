## A Glimpse
Here is a short passage featuring Maarga Sangeet on Chandraveena, in Dhrupad style, accompanied by a Pakhawaj and Tanpura.

By no means does this clip fully represent and showcase the tradition of Maarga Sangeet or the musical form of Dhrupad. But it provides a glimpse into the musical improvisations and expressive power that is possible. To better understand and appreciate Maarga Sangeet, and specifically Dhrupad, let us begin by tracing the origins of Indian Classical music.

## Introduction
>Maarga Sangeet is a tradition of Indian Classical music, a way of life where music becomes the artist's medium of communication.

From early Vedic periods, music has been recognised as a powerful means of expressing and stimulating emotions. As humans, we intrinsically respond to music and rhythm, regardless of the form and genre of music. Scientific research has shown that even plants and animals respond to music [^1]. The first significant step in the development of Indian Classical music happened with the Saama Veda. Taking the ritualistic, introspective and philosophical chants from the Rig Veda, Saama Veda added an element of singing to Vedic recitation. Listen to this chant from Rig Veda.

[^1]: Scientists have studied the effects of music on non-human subjects including animals such as cats or monkeys, and even plants. The studies have found that music does have an impact on the health and well-being of the non-human subjects. For example, see [1](https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=ajps.2007.369.373), [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291086163_Effect_of_Music_on_Plants_-_An_Overview) and [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3677178/pdf/ars206.pdf) for music's effect on plants and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/laban.162), [5](https://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(15)00060-X/abstract) and [6](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/30.short) for music's effect on animals.

Rig Veda chants already incorporated the concept of intonations. The intonations are called Svarita (neutral drone), Udaatta (higher note) and Anudaatta (lower note). As you can hear from the example above, it is not a monotone chant, but there are accents to syllables which create a three note chant, called Gaathik chant. These three intonations form the foundation for the Dhrupad style of Maarga Sangeet, and are fundamental to the musical form even today. Now, listen to this chant from Saama Veda.

As you can see, in Saama Veda singing, the number of notes has expanded beyond Rig Veda chants. If you are familiar with Indian Classical music, you may notice early examples of musical characteristics like Meend (glides), Gamakam (note oscillation), Hrasva (short note) and Deergha (long note) which continue to be an integral part of Indian Classical Music today.

Notice how even this small step of adding musical notes and phrases, already makes a big difference in the feeling evoked by Saama Veda singing, as compared to Rig Veda chants. Over time, the musical rules and principles evolved to take their own form and identity separate from Saama Veda, and came to be classified as an Upaveda (a subsidiary Vedic text) called the Gandharva Veda. It was the Gandharva Veda which first laid down the framework of Maarga Sangeet. And from Gandharva Veda came the methods, structure and grammar to learn, practise and perform music - the first seeds of Indian Classical Music.

Despite its ancient origins, Indian Classical music has continuously evolved over millennia and remains very much contemporary and relevant today, for any artist who aspires to learn and walk the path of Maarga Sangeet. Today, it is practised and performed in a number of styles, broadly classified as Hindustani, Carnatic and Dhrupad.

The musical form I have chosen to follow is called Dhrupad, as practiced by my Gurus, and in the form I have learned and understood. Dhrupad, a shortening of Dhruva-Pada (fixed verse), is a style of music evolved from a poetry based musical style called Prabandha (arrangement). In its contemporary musical form, Dhrupad consists of two sections, Anibaddha (unbound) which is a free flowing music also called Aalap, and Nibaddha (bound) which is a poetry or instrumental composition set to a fixed cycle of beats. Dhrupad is characterised by a gradual and methodical unfurling of the musical possibilities of the Raaga.

In my pursuit, the Chandraveena is my musical instrument of choice, to help me to portray Dhrupad in all its finesse. Chandraveena is a contemporary string instrument based on the Saraswati Veena, a traditional Indian string instrument. It has been specially designed to enable the artist to create elaborate musical phrases and subtle intonations which are a hallmark of the Dhrupad style, while still retaining the sonic character of the Saraswati Veena. Chandraveena has a calm, deep and resonating sound, which creates the ideal soundscape for the contemplative nature of Dhrupad music.

## Structure of a Performance

As mentioned before, there are two main parts to a Dhrupad rendition, called the **Aalap** and the **Composition**.

### Aalap

The Aalap is performed without any rhythmic accompaniment.

>Om Anantam Tvam Tarana Tarana Tvam Hari Narayana Om

Vocalists in Dhrupad often use syllables like Ri, Na, Te, Ta, Ra and Na, as abstract syllables to sing Aalap. These syllables are derived from the chant above known as the Vishnu Mantra. For instrumentalists, particularly Veena players, the practice is to use a combination of plucking and finger strokes to simulate these syllables.

The Aalap is performed in three parts.

1. The first part is again called **Aalap**. This is the free flowing exposition of a Raaga (melody) within the Grammar of the Raaga, and the style of Dhrupad. Here, we explore different facets of the Raaga, the subtleties of every note and phrase, and use of different Alankars (ornamentation) to effectively bring out emotions, all the while maintaining the purity of the structure.

2. **Jod** is the second part of Aalap, where there is a sense of self-rhythm or pulse created which is built into the musical phrases. The self-rhythm is created by the appropriate use of the rhythm strings built in the instrument.

3. **Jhala** is the faster rhythmic section of the aalap. In this section, there is extensive use of the rhythm strings, creating a feeling of dancing movements.

### Composition

The composition is either a lyrical poetry (in case of vocal music) or a musical phrase (instrumental composition called Gat) created to a certain fixed rhythmic cycle. Some of the most common rhythmic cycles are Chautal (12 beats), Dhamaar (14 beats) and Tivra (7 beats). Here, we create different improvised rhythmic musical phrases within the framework of the Raaga, and repeatedly rejoin the main basic phrase, either over a single cycle or after multiple cycles.

## Thanks for Listening!

This has been quite a long introduction. If you have made it this far, I appreciate your patience. But even this is just a beginning - there is much much more to Dhrupad. It has been an extraordinary journey for me, and it is very much an ongoing one! Every day is an opportunity to improve, to be one with the musical form, and to be able to emote through the medium of music to you, my listeners.

I hope you enjoyed the music. And do check out my complete performances from the Discography page. Thanks for listening!
