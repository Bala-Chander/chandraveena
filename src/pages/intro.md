Welcome! Here is an introduction to my music on the Chandraveena and how it relates to Maarga Sangeet and Dhrupad. For full length recordings, please check out my <a href="/discography/"><inline-button>Discography</inline-button></a>.

## A Glimpse
Before we begin, here is a brief glimpse of a typical Chandraveena recital.

By no means does this clip fully represent and showcase the musical form, but it provides a glimpse into the musical improvisations and expressive power that is possible. To better understand and appreciate, let us begin by tracing the origins of Indian music.

## Maarga Sangeet

## Raga, Tala and Dhrupad
> Statement on Raga, Tala and Dhrupad - approach to improvisation or crafting a musical performance.

The musical form I have chosen to follow is based on the fundamental principles of Dhrupad, as practiced by my Gurus, and in the form I have learned and understood. Dhrupad, a shortening of Dhruva-Pada (fixed verse), is a style of music evolved from a poetry based musical style called Prabandha (arrangement). In its contemporary musical form, Dhrupad consists of two sections, Anibaddha (unbound) which is a free flowing music also called Aalap, and Nibaddha (bound) which is a poetry or instrumental composition set to a fixed cycle of beats accompanied by a percussion instrument. Dhrupad is characterised by a gradual and methodical unfurling of the musical possibilities of the Raaga.

## Chandraveena
> Brief statement on Chandraveena

In my pursuit, the Chandraveena is my musical instrument of choice, to help me to portray different aspects of Indian music in all its finesse. Chandraveena is a contemporary string instrument based on the Saraswati Veena, a traditional Indian string instrument. It has been specially designed to enable the artist to create elaborate musical phrases and subtle intonations. Chandraveena has a calm, deep and resonating sound, which creates the ideal soundscape for the contemplative music.

## Structure of a Performance

As mentioned before, there are two main parts to a Dhrupad rendition, called the **Aalap** and the **Composition**.

### Aalap

The Aalap is performed without any rhythmic accompaniment.

>Om Anantam Tvam Tarana Tarana Tvam Hari Narayana Om

Vocalists in Dhrupad often use syllables like Ri, Na, Te, Ta, Ra and Na, as abstract syllables to sing Aalap. These syllables are derived from the chant above known as the Vishnu Mantra. For instrumentalists, particularly Veena players, the practice is to use a combination of plucking and finger strokes to simulate these syllables.

The Aalap is performed in three parts.

1. The first part is again called **Aalap**. This is the free flowing exposition of a Raaga (melody) within the Grammar of the Raaga, and the rules of Dhrupad. Here, we explore different facets of the Raaga, the subtleties of every note and phrase, and use of different Alankars (ornamentation) to effectively bring out emotions, all the while maintaining the purity of the structure.

2. **Jod** is the second part of Aalap, where there is a sense of self-rhythm or pulse created which is built into the musical phrases. The self-rhythm is created by the appropriate use of the rhythm strings built in the instrument.

3. **Jhala** is the faster rhythmic section of the aalap. In this section, there is extensive use of the rhythm strings, creating a feeling of dancing movements.

### Composition

The composition is either a lyrical poetry (in case of vocal music) or a musical phrase (instrumental composition called Gat) created to a certain fixed rhythmic cycle. Some of the most common rhythmic cycles are Chautal (12 beats), Dhamaar (14 beats) and Tivra (7 beats). Here, we create different improvised rhythmic musical phrases within the framework of the Raaga, and repeatedly rejoin the main basic phrase, either over a single cycle or after multiple cycles.

## Thanks for Listening!

This has been quite a long introduction. If you have made it this far, I appreciate your patience. But even this is just a beginning - there is much much more to Indian classical music. It has been an extraordinary journey for me, and it is very much an ongoing one! Every day is an opportunity to improve, to be one with the musical form, and to be able to emote through the medium of music to you, my listeners.

I hope you enjoyed the music. And do check out my complete performances from the Discography page. Thanks for listening!
