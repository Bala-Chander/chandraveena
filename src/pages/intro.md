## an Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my journey of Maarga Sangeet. This is my understanding of the term and the music, and a brief on what its all about.

Maarga Sangeet is a Musical Path where music becomes the medium of communication. From early Vedic periods, music has been recognised as a powerful means of emoting. All of us intrinsically respond to music and rhythm, independent of the form and type of music. Recently, scientific research has also show that plants and animals respond to music, though this has been indentified in some of the early Indian scriptures. To put it in perspective, most of Sama Veda are chants from Rig Veda rendered in musical form.

As you can already see the difference, Sama Veda chants started using more musical notes and phrases as compared to Rig Veda chants.


Over a period of time, as music evolved, it took its own form and identity seperate from Sama Veda and evolved into an important sub-veda (upaveda) called Gandharva Veda. Gradually, discipline, structure and grammar were developed to learn and follow music, the first seeds of Indian Classical Music. Many great minds, and intellectuals have contributed into further enriching this form of music, and it has continuously evolved over the milleniums. Today, we have a very refined form of music available to us, in a systematic form to learn and further walk the path of Maarga Sangeet.

The form I have chosen to follow is called Dhrupad, as practiced by my Gurus, and in the form I have learnt and understood. Dhrupad in its essence traces its origin to the Sama Veda chants. Dhrupad (though technically means "Dhruva" (Fixed} + "Pada" (Poetry)) has evolved beyond just recitation of fixed poetry.

I have also chosen to use Chandraveena as my musical instrument medium to portray Dhrupad in all its finesse. Chandraveena has been designed to respond to the most subtle of variations and colorations of notes and phrases, and has a very calm, deep and resonating sound, which creates the ideal atmosphere for this form of music.

There are two main parts to a Dhrupad rendition :

_The first part is:_

**Aalap :**


Aalap in turn has three parts to it : 

**Aalap** is the free flowing exposition of a Raaga (Melody) within the framework of the Grammar of the Raaga. Here, we explore different facets of the Raaga, explore the subtlities of every note and phrase, and use every possible Alankar (embellishments) all the while maintaining the purity of the structure. The whole endevor here is to be able to effectively emote. 
**Jod** is the second part of Aalap where there is a sense of self-rhythm built into the phrases. The self-rhythm is created by the appropriate use of the rhythm strings built in the instrument.
**Jhala** is the faster rhythmic section of the aalap. In this section there is extensive use of the rhythm strings creating a feeling of dancing movements.

None of the above have rhythmic accompaniment.

_The second part is:_

**Composition**

Composition is either a poetry (in case of vocal music) or a musical phrase created to a certain fixed rhythmic cycle. Some of the most common rhythmic cycles are Chautal (12 beats), Dhamar (14 beats), Tivra (7 beats) etc. Here we create different improvised rhythmic musical phrases within the framework of the Raaga, and either over a single cycle or multiple cycles join the main base phrase.



This has been a extraordinary journey for me, and an ongoing one where everyday there is a continuous process to improve oneself, be in one with the musical form and be able to emote through the medium of music to my listeners.
