## A Glimpse
Here's a short passage featuring Maarga Sangeet on Chandraveena, accompanied by a Pakhawaj and Tanpura.

<mark>Right up front, we should play a 2 minute clip featuring an intense passage, to kindle the listener's curiosity</mark>

By no means does this clip fully represent and showcase the musical form of Maarga Sangeet. But it  provides a glimpse into the musical improvisations and expressive power that it makes possible. To better understand and appreciate Maarga Sangeet, let us begin by tracing its origins.

## Introduction
>Maarga Sangeet is a tradition of Indian Classical music, a way of life where music becomes the artist's medium of communication.

From early Vedic periods, music has been recognised as a powerful means of expressing and stimulating emotions. As humans, we intrinsically respond to music and rhythm, regardless of the form and genre of music. Scientific research has shown that even plants and animals respond to music.<mark>We need a citation for this claim</mark>. The first significant step in the development of Indian Classical music happened with the Sama Veda. Taking the introspective and philosophical chants from the Rig Veda, Sama Veda added an element of singing to Vedic recitation.

Notice how even this small step of adding musical notes and phrases, already makes a big difference in the feeling evoked by Sama Veda singing, as compared to Rig Veda chants.

Over time, musical rules and principles evolved to take their own form and identity separate from Sama Veda, and came to be classified as an Upaveda (a subsidiary Vedic text) called the Gandharva Veda. From Gandharva Veda came the methods, structure and grammar to learn, practise and perform music - the first seeds of Indian Classical Music.

Despite its ancient origins, Indian Classical music has continuously evolved over millennia and remains very much contemporary and relevant today, for any artist who aspires to learn and walk the path of Maarga Sangeet.

The music I have chosen to follow is called Dhrupad, as practiced by my Gurus, and in the form I have learned and understood. While the term "Dhrupad" is derived from the words "Dhruva" meaning fixed and "Pada" meaning poetry, Dhrupad has evolved way beyond the recitation of fixed poetry, into a sophisticated and powerful musical form.

In my pursuit, the Chandraveena is my musical instrument of choice, to help me to portray Dhrupad in all its finesse. Chandraveena has a calm, deep and resonating sound, which creates the ideal soundscape for this form of music. Further, it has been designed to render the most subtle variations and colourations of notes and phrases.

## Structure of a Performance

There are two main parts to a Dhrupad rendition, called the **Aalap** and the **Composition**.

### Aalap

The Aalap in turn is performed in three parts, without any rhythmic accompaniment.

1. The first part is again called **Aalap**. This is the free flowing exposition of a Raaga (Melody) within the framework of the Grammar of the Raaga. Here, we explore different facets of the Raaga, explore the subtleties of every note and phrase, and use every possible Alankar (embellishments) all the while maintaining the purity of the structure. The whole endeavour here is to be able to effectively emote.

<mark>Insert video clip of Aalap. This explanation should be made a bit shorter. Specifically, "every possible Alankar" conveys the idea of mechanical combinations. Also, the aim to "effectively emote" is very universal and difficult to apply exclusively to Aalap.</mark>

2. **Jod** is the second part of Aalap, where there is a sense of self-rhythm built into the phrases. The self-rhythm is created by the appropriate use of the rhythm strings built in the instrument.

3. **Jhala** is the faster rhythmic section of the aalap. In this section, there is extensive use of the rhythm strings, creating a feeling of dancing movements.

### Composition

The composition is either a lyrical poetry (in case of vocal music) or a musical phrase created to a certain fixed rhythmic cycle. Some of the most common rhythmic cycles are Chautal (12 beats), Dhamaar (14 beats) and Tivra (7 beats). Here, we create different improvised rhythmic musical phrases within the framework of the Raaga, and repeatedly joining the main basic phrase, either over a single cycle or after multiple cycles.

## Thanks for Listening!

It has been a extraordinary journey for me, and it is very much an ongoing one! Every day is an opportunity to improve, to be one with the musical form, and to be able to emote through the medium of music to you, my listeners.
