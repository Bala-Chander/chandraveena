Chandraveena music is supported by the patronage of listeners like you. If you like my musical philosophy and musical works, I am grateful for your appreciation and deeply value your patronage. Here are some ways in which you can enjoy the music better, help it find more listeners and provide your support so that it continues to thrive.

## Invest your Time
Chandraveena music is my attempt to create an individualistic style of music, rooted in Indian Classical music and influenced by Carnatic and Dhrupad (Dagar) traditions. It is contemplative in nature and is characterised by a slow and methodical unfurling of a Raga. My endeavour is to present the music in a transparent manner and provide listeners with all the information pertaining to the Raga and Tala being performed. My request to all the listeners is to take their time to get to know the music. Just as it grew on me during my formative years, I hope you can invest your valuable time and enjoy the music more and more over time.

## Host a Concert
The best way to experience Indian Classical music is to hear it in intimate surroundings, in a small gathering of people, at a close proximity to the artist. A concert at such a gathering is called a *Baithak* (referring to the tradition of sitting down on the floor in front of the artist). Chandraveena too is best enjoyed in such gatherings, so that its deep resonance and subtle intonations can be heard at close quarters. You can help the music reach your friends and neighbours, by hosting a Chandraveena concert. If you wish to do so, please [leave me a message](/contact/).
